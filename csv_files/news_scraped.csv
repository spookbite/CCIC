Loan growth was driven by strong traction in Commercial and Rural Banking and Retail loans. The corporate book witnessed a marginal QoQ decline.

NIM was higher by 11bps at 4.84% due to superior yields driven by faster asset repricing, while cost of funds was a tad lesser. Retail wholesale mix improved QoQ from 43:57 to 45:55 led by stronger retail accretion (due to healthy consumption spends) and de-growth in corporate (owing to pricing pressure and widening bond spreads). Retail deposit accretion was strong at 5% QoQ and its share is now 84% (80% in Mar’22).

"  January 16, 2023 / 02:42 PM IST  ",Buy HDFC Bank; target of Rs 1925: Emkay Global Financial,"Emkay Global Financial's research report on HDFC BankHDFCB reported moderate credit growth at 20% YoY/2% QoQ, mainly due to de-growth in the corporate book which, coupled with flattish margin and elevated opex, led to moderate PPoP growth at 13%. However, lower than expected provisions led to a beat on earnings at Rs123bn (vs expectations of Rs119bn) up 18.5% YoY. HDFC Bank remains one of the few banks to clock a strong deposit growth amid rising competition for deposits, given its robust franchisee. On the credit front, HDFC Bank remains opportunistic on the corporate side; thus, we are not too worried about the 3Q growth moderation. Bank continues to clock strong growth in the retail/SME segment which we believe should support its margins amid rising cost pressure. The merger process is on the fast track, with shareholder approval now in place; the bank is hopeful of it being completed earlier than guided. That said, clarity on the stake of HDFC Life and other subsidiaries as well as on the merger structure by the RBI remains elusive. Notwithstanding the merger-related regulatory overhang, we believe HDFCB offers the best play on India’s consumption story and is also a good defensive bet in current choppy waters.

Management sees strong traction in the large deal pipeline, despite an adverse demand environment. The weakness is clearly visible in parts of Retail, Hi-Tech, Financials (Mortgages and IB), and Telecom. Despite the weakness, INFO raised its FY23 revenue growth guidance to 16.0-16.5% YoY in CC terms from 15-16% earlier, implying a limited impact from macro headwinds next quarter. EBIT margin was flat QoQ at 21.5% in 3QFY23, in line with our estimate. Easing supply, a 6% drop in quarterly annualized attrition, utilization buffer, and fresher deployment should help INFO to deliver 21.2% margin in FY23, in line with the lower end of its EBIT margin guidance of 21-22%. We are positively surprised by a TCV of USD3.3b, the second highest in its history and up 20% QoQ despite pressure on end-demand. Strong vendor consolidation deals and cost optimization projects continue to help INFO to gain market share. LTM large deal TCV of ~USD10b and guidance upgrade should more than adequately cushion the near-term headwind from weak macro and assuage growth concerns. Strong traction in vendor consolidation and cost takeout deals should help INFO to deliver an ~11% revenue CAGR over FY22-25, despite macro headwinds in H1FY24. We factor in a margin of 21.2%/21.5%/22.0% in FY23E/FY24E/FY25E, leading to a 13.5% PAT CAGR over FY22-25E.OutlookWe expect INFO to be a key beneficiary of acceleration in IT spends.

Despite the easy 3Q comp (among the weakest topline growth in our large cap IT services coverage) and strong order intake (USD4.3b, 1.5x book-to-bill), WPRO has guided for a muted 4Q USD CC revenue growth of -0.6% to 1.0% QoQ. Q3 EBIT margin in IT Services was up 120bp QoQ to 16.3%, ahead of our expectation of 15.4% due to better employee cost control and the reversal of one-off costs incurred last quarter. We were disappointed by WPRO’s weak implied 4QFY23 revenue growth guidance, given the continued strength in deal momentum over the last few quarters. Management indicated that near-term deal conversion was affected by slower decision-making (macro overhang) and a longer tenure (4-5 years) of transformation deals, especially the ones with hyperscalars (44% contribution of the total TCV). Management, however, remains optimistic that the strong deal pipeline and robust order bookings will continue in 4Q, which should help WPRO deliver better growth in FY24. Given the tepid conversion of strong TCV over the last 6-8 quarters, we are concerned that growth challenges might continue and WPRO may lag its peers even in FY24 in terms of revenue/earnings growth. We are factoring in a USD revenue CAGR of 7.3% over FY22-25, among the lowest in our IT Services coverage. In terms of margins, the company exceeded our expectations by 90bp QoQ and delivered 16.3% (IT service EBIT) despite two months of wage hikes and promotions at senior levels. Management remains confident to sustain margin at the 3QFY23 level and indicates further improvement over a new base. We expect FY23/FY24/FY25 margins to be 15.5%/16.4%/17.0%, which should translate to a 6.6% CAGR in INR PAT over FY22-25 – among the lowest in our IT Services coverage.OutlookWe raise our FY23 and FY25 EPS estimate by 4% but lower our FY24 EPS estimate marginally to factor in weaker growth next year due to a lower exit rate in 4Q. We maintain our Neutral stance as we view the current valuation as fair.
