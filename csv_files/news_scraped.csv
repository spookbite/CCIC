A weak margin offset an otherwise strong outlook, it added. Core EBITDA margin came in at 8.7 percent, flat QoQ and 80 bps lower YoY.Even CLSA said that a decline in core engineering and construction margins was also a disappointment. Moreover, the key surprise was mega defence orders which L&T did not announce.At 09:57 am, L&T was quoting at Rs 2,241.05, down Rs 125.70, or 5.31 percent. The scrip was trading with volumes of 104,987 shares today, as compared with its thirty-day average of 79,903 shares, an increase of 31 percent.The Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) major L&T on May 10 reported a consolidated net profit for the quarter ended March 2023 at Rs 3,987 crore, up 10 percent compared to Rs 3,621 crore in the same quarter last year. Revenue stood at Rs 58,335 crore, a growth of 10 percent from Rs 52,851 crore a year ago.CLSA highlighted that the company’s Q4 beat three out of four guidance targets and the management guided for an even stronger FY24 on a higher base. The brokerage house has a ‘buy’ rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 2,790.Catch up on all LIVE stock market updates hereGoldman Sachs has a ‘buy’ rating on the EPC major’s shares with a target price of Rs 2,540.HDFC Securities said that the margin was impacted largely by higher input prices in projects and manufacturing portfolios.FY23 order inflow rose 20 percent YoY to Rs 2.3 trillion, even as 4Q inflows increased marginally around 3 percent YoY given a high base. Order book at Rs 4 trillion as of March FY23 is at a record high. International orders share has increased to 43 percent in the quarter under review from 39 percent in Q4 FY22 while private orders share declined to 18 percent from 22 percent.L&T has guided for an order book and sales growth of 10–12 percent and 12–15 percent respectively for FY24 along with margin guidance of 9–9.1 percent given 40 percent of older projects, which had cost hits, have been already executed while the remaining shall get executed over next 12–24 months.Talking about profitability, the company said in its conference call that after an 8.6 percent core EBITDA margin for FY23, it believes the worst is behind us for the projects it secured. Orders that the company bagged in later FY22 and in FY23 factor into account current input costs and better margin trajectories which it will see in the latter part of FY24.Nuvama Institutional Equities has factored in the upper end of sales growth guidance of 12–15 percent with a delayed margin recovery. The domestic brokerage firm has retained its ‘buy’ rating with a hike in target price to Rs 2,750 from Rs 2,700.",Larsen & Toubro Ltd.
"  May 11, 2023 / 04:21 PM IST  ",Succession Season Finale: L&T’s AM Naik steps down to make way for SN Subrahmanyan,"In 1964, the 22-year-old AM Naik appeared for an interview at Larsen & Toubro Ltd. He was initially offered the role of an assistant engineer for a salary of Rs 760 per month. But after a final interview with Gunnar Hansen, who later rose to become the Deputy Managing Director, the offer was downgraded to Rs 670 a month for the role of a junior engineer.“Hansen thinks you are overconfident,” Naik was told.Naik accepted the role anyway. After 58 years with L&T, 25 of which he spent in top roles, the man who drove the conglomerate’s growth and made it a $23-billion multinational with a diversified portfolio, is finally hanging up his boots.AMN, as Naik is popularly known, will step down as the Non-Executive Chairman of the L&T group at the end of his tenure on September 30, 2023. The board of L&T has decided to confer the status of Chairman Emeritus on him.ALSO READ: L&T’s FY24 revenue growth seen at 12-15%, order intake growth at 10-12%: CFO“L&T has been my life,” Naik said in a statement announcing the change in leadership.“I am immensely proud that I could play a significant part in its growth. The growth trajectory that the company has charted in the last two to three decades is exemplary. The emphasis we laid on IT and technology services has had a significant positive impact on the profitability of the organisation. Going forward also, I am sure that Mr Subrahmanyan will continue to foster the high growth and entrepreneurial culture at L&T. In him, L&T has a highly capable, passionate and empathetic leader,” Naik said.Change of guardSN Subrahmanyan, who is currently the Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of the company, will take over as Chairman and Managing Director with effect from October 1.Subrahmanyan, who was promoted to the role of CEO and MD in 2017, was selected after a rigorous process. Naik groomed him for the top job for three years before his elevation.“I must humbly submit that all that we have been able to achieve has been with the utmost support of all L&Tites, and of course with the firm backing of Mr Naik. Mr Naik contributed significantly to building what we know today as L&T. I would humbly like to take up this responsibility and take the legacy of trust, customer focus, timely delivery, quality, people centricity, and professionalism forward,” Subrahmanyan said.Big shoes to fillSoon after the company informed the bourses about the change in leadership, responding to a question by Moneycontrol’s reporter in a conference call, L&T Chief Financial Officer R Shankar Raman said, “The company has been planning the succession for quite some time now. I think we have very big shoes to fill.”L&T’s storied history is witness to how Naik faced, resisted, and succeeded in bitter takeover battles. L&T retained its ownership twice in the past when Grasim, and later the undivided Reliance Industries, made attempts to take over.Naik was instrumental in ring-fencing L&T against takeovers by setting up an employees’ welfare trust which owns stake in the company, along with institutional investors.Naik led L&T’s many diversifications, most notably in information technology, as also the initial public offerings of its subsidiaries. He also helped the company change gears by divesting non-core assets and becoming an asset-light leviathan.There were some brickbats too, about Naik not making way for a successor. For years, there was speculation about when Naik would pass on the baton to his successor. Every time a succession deadline would draw near, Naik would surprise everyone.In 2012, when he was scheduled to retire, L&T split the post of chairman and managing director, retaining Naik as Chairman while extending his tenure,  and appointed K Venkataramanan as Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director.In 2015, when Venkataramanan was due to retire, instead of appointing someone to the job, L&T yet again split the position and appointed Subrahmanyan as the Deputy Managing Director and President. This move was seen to be aimed at making Subrahmanyan’s march to the MD’s post (and then the Chairman’s) longer, allowing Naik to continue. But that was then.Next waveWhile Naik faced many challenges during his tenure, Subrahmanyan, or SNS as he is widely called, steered L&T through the most unprecedented times during the Covid pandemic.Subrahmanyan battled the migration of workers from project sites on the one hand, and focused on value accretive growth on the other. As the pandemic accelerated the shift to digitisation, he triggered L&T’s next growth spurt by setting up and expanding new age digital and technology-led businesses.L&T has in the past designed strategic plans and executed them under the stewardship of Naik. It has now embarked on its most ambitious strategic 5-year plan thus far — Lakshya ’26.This plan aims to double revenues and order inflow in five years, by 2025-26, targets exiting non-core operations, and expansion  of the services business. L&T is aiming for a revenue of Rs 2.7 trillion by FY25-26 as against Rs 1.4 trillion in FY20-21. It is eyeing an order inflow of Rs 3.4 trillion crore by FY25-26, as against Rs 1.7 trillion crore in FY20-21.This will be Subrahmanyan’s  biggest test.“Mr Naik will be available to all of us for consultation, given his long history with the company… you can't take L&T out of him,’’ said Raman.In March 2015, when Naik completed 50 years at L&T, he spoke to employees, former executives, and members of different unions in the presence of former President APJ Abdul Kalam and the then Shiv Sena supremo, Uddhav Thackeray, and shared his ideas about L&T’s future.Naik stood right next to the C Block on L&T’s campus at Powai, Mumbai, where he started his career in 1965 as a junior engineer, and signed off after his speech by singing “Jeena yahan, marna yahan, iske siva jaana kahan.” (You live here, you die here. Where else can one go but here?)Disclosure: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

"  May 11, 2023 / 01:09 PM IST  ",Buy UPL; target of Rs 880: Sharekhan,"Sharekhan's research report on UPLWeak Q4FY23 results with a 2%/400 bps miss in consolidated revenue/EBITDA margin at Rs. 16,569 crore/18.2%, up/down 4.5%/445 y-o-y due to a decline in post-patent product price, idle capacity costs, and a higher share of low-margin LatAM region. Adjusted PAT of Rs. 821 crore (down 46% y-o-y and 52% below our estimate) was further impacted by higher depreciation and tax rate. North America revenue fell by 14% y-o-y to Rs. 3,009 crore due to steep decline in Glufosinate prices and delayed spring impacted herbicides/insecticides demand. Revenue from LatAM/Europe/India/RoW grew by 11.9%/6.5%/14.7%/5.9% y-o-y. Volume remained muted at +1% y-o-y while product realisation declined by 3% y-o-y and there was positive currency impact of 6% y-o-y. FY23 EBITDA growth of 10% missed guidance of 15-18% due to subdued Q4. FY24 revenue/EBITDA guidance growth of 6-10%/8-12% would also be dependent upon recovery in H2FY24 as oversupply from China would keep product price/margin under check in H1FY24. We thus cut our FY24/FY25 earnings estimate sharply by 24%/16%.OutlookValuation of 11.4x/8.9x FY24E/FY25E EPS seems attractive and thus we maintain a Buy on UPL but with a lower PT of Rs. 880 (to reflect an earnings cut).For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

"  May 11, 2023 / 08:47 PM IST  ","Cheaper pizzas, burgers! Zomato starves in trade as ONDC poses a threat","The Indian government-made Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), which lets restaurants sell food directly to consumers without the need for a third party seems to be giving tough competition to the private rivals,  Swiggy and Zomato.Screenshots comparing food items on Zomato and ONDC have taken social media by storm. A plain Margherita pizza costs Rs 195 on Zomato and Rs 156 on ONDC, about 20 percent cheaper. The non-veg lovers will have to shell out Rs 280 for a McChicken Burger on Zomato but only Rs 109 on ONDC.With ONDC becoming a possible threat to Zomato and Swiggy's market share, Zomato's shares have tumbled over 5 percent in trade, said analysts.At 11 am, Zomato was quoting at Rs 62.50 on the NSE, lower by 3.7 percent from the previous close, amid heavy volumes of 46 million shares.Follow our live blog for all the market actionWhat is ONDC? ONDC or Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) is backed by the government and seeks to prevent the dominance of a few large platforms in e-commerce and food delivery sectors like Amazon, Flipkart, Swiggy and Zomato.With the network, the government hopes to increase e-commerce penetration in the country to 25 percent in the next two years, reaching 900 million buyers and 1.2 million sellers through the network and reaching a gross merchandise value of $48 billion.Also Read: ONDC food and grocery orders double in a week to shoot past 10,000 a dayThreat to Zomato, Swiggy?As restaurants move to ONDC, Karan Taurani of Elara Capital believes raising commission rates could be tough for Zomato over the medium term, which is a key driver for their profitability guidance.""ONDC augurs well for food as a product which has lower average order value versus e-commerce and white goods, where there are trust issues,"" Taurani said.However, it will be a long road for ONDC to win over customers. Some users who ordered food through ONDC complained about stale food and longer delivery time, over 90 minutes in some cases.Taurani also stated that concerns over Zomato or Swiggy's market share decline will hold ground, provided ONDC's user experience improves over a period of time. ""Currently, it is very poor"", he said.Meanwhile, Digant Haria of GreenEdge Wealth believes the market is large enough for multiple players to survive. ""It is too early to say whether ONDC is a threat as it is in the nascent stages of adoption,"" he said.Also Read: ONDC will be driven by competition and fair practices, not unhealthy discounting: CEO T KoshyZomato and Swiggy also hold an edge when it comes to making restaurants discoverable. Small eateries can pay a commission to the food delivery platforms to rank higher and make themselves more visible to people in nearby areas.""ONDC does not do this. So, only well-established players like Domino's with its own strong delivery network can think of moving to ONDC. Small restaurants do not have the luxury,"" Haria said.Amid finding a path to profitability, Zomato and Swiggy's battle with ONDC will certainly be a long-drawn one.
