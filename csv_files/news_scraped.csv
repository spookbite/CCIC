We note even at a realisation of USD 75.5/bbl for oil and ~INR 21/scm for gas, our standalone and consolidated EPS estimates of INR 38.4/sh and INR 39.3/sh for FY24E are well above the average EPS for FY22/FY23, respectively. With stronger production from KG field likely available by FY25, our FY25E EPS estimate of INR 45.6 signifies stronger earnings prospects, even with capped realisations on oil and gas. We believe valuation at 3.9x FY24E consolidated EPS and 2.5x EV/EBITDA remains attractive. Reiterate BUY.OutlookWe cut our FY24E and F25E EPS by 5.1% and 1.6%, respectively, to factor in lower gas production and marginally lower realisation. However, stronger long-term price assumptions and stronger cashflow drive a small 1% uptick in the target price to INR 220/sh, 24% upside from CMP.
