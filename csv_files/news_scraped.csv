Paytm shares on August 24 closed 0.15 percent lower at Rs 904.20 apiece on BSE.Earlier on August 7, the company informed the exchanges that Vijay Shekhar Sharma, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of One 97 Communications Limited and Antfin have entered into an agreement where Sharma will purchase a 10.3 percent stake in Paytm.As per the filing, an overseas entity 100 percent owned by Sharma called Resilient Asset Management BV will acquire the stake in Paytm from Antfin through an off-market transfer. On closing of this transaction, Sharma’s shareholding in Paytm will increase to 19.42 percent, whereas Antfin’s shareholding will reduce to 13.5 percent.Also read: Vijay Shekhar Sharma goes all in, is now the largest shareholder in PaytmExit of shareholdersIn February this year, Alibaba Group sold its remaining stake in Paytm for about Rs 1,378 crore or $167.14 million through a block deal. Ant Group, part of Alibaba Group which also owns Antfin, had also sold Zomato stake late last year for $200 million.Alibaba had exited online grocery firm Bigbasket back in 2021. In mid-2022, Alibaba had also exited Paytm Mall. Alibaba has been under Chinese government pressure due to his criticism of the Chinese government's interference.Not just Antfin, but other Paytm shareholders have been exiting the company. SoftBank has been offloading shares regularly over the last couple of months in small tranches through open market transactions and largely at a profit as Paytm’s share price has been above Rs 830 during the period, which was the cost price for the Japanese investor. The sale in July generated over $200 million for the Japanese investment.SVF India Holdings (Cayman) Ltd, a SoftBank arm, had sold 13,103,148 shares between February 10, 2023, and May 8, 2023, which represents approximately 2.07 percent of the total shareholding for about $120 million.Softbank's exits had to do with the pressure on the Japanese technology investment firm to pare its losses.Chinese shareholding concernAfter the Doklam skirmishes between the Indian and Chinese armies, the Indian government has been blocking most of the Chinese investments into India. It had also banned more than 200 Chinese apps over the last three years.The government and the central bank have concerns regarding the large Chinese shareholding in Paytm, a major player in India's financial services space. It is believed that this could be one of the reasons why a couple of approvals are still pending with the regulator.",One 97 Communications Ltd.

""The growth was driven by premiumisation and productivity interventions, as the company continued to make sequential progress in profit growth, despite the challenging operating and cost environment,"" the management said in an exchange filing.Net sales also grew 12.31 percent on-year to Rs 848.74 crore during the quarter under review thanks to the company's strong brand fundamentals and integrated growth strategy.Follow our live blog for all the market actionIts EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margin also expanded sharply by 1,630 basis points on year to 25.2 percent in April-June.Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services also stands impressed by the company's sharp margin improvement. It believes that there are two factors - the company's huge category growth potential in the feminine hygiene segment, coupled with scope for market share gains and potential for higher margin growth from premiumisation in the category over the long term which makes P&G Hygiene and Health an attractive long-term core holding.However, even though the firm remains positive on the company's long-term growth potential, the uncertain pace of recovery and challenging valuations which come around 65 times its FY24 EPS (earnings-per-stock) estimates prompt MOFSL to maintain a neutral rating on the stock.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

"  August 29, 2023 / 09:24 AM IST  ","Brokerages maintain RIL stock rating and target price, turn attention to earnings after AGM","Several brokerages have maintained their rating and target price on India's most valuable company Reliance Industries Ltd after the annual general meeting (AGM).Analysts are a tad concerned about the market's disappointment due to the absence of a spin-off timeline guidance for Jio and Retail. With the AGM concluded, attention is expected to turn toward earnings, which analysts predict will now be the primary focus. Notably, their estimates are 20% lower than the consensus.Analysts' viewBrokerage firm Jefferies India maintained a buy rating with a target price at Rs 2,950 a share, JM Financials retained its buy rating and target price of Rs 2,900 a share while Kotak Institutional Equities maintained an add rating and kept the target price at Rs 2,600 a share. Nomura retained its buy rating and kept a target price at Rs 2,925, up from Rs 2,444 a share. Macquarie Research has maintained its underperform rating and expects a target price at Rs 2,100, down 14.6 percent from current market value.RIL had revealed board approvals for Isha Ambani, Akash Ambani, and Anant Ambani to be inducted as non-executive directors. Mukesh Ambani will remain CMD for 5 more years, focusing on nurturing and guiding the next-gen leaders, particularly his three children, while also enhancing RIL's institutional culture.""We believe the decision to elevate the next generation of the Ambani family to the Board of RIL, enables them to further develop on their experience of running key RIL businesses and will position them well to continue driving growth for the organisation,"" Nomura Research said in its latest note.Jio revealed plans for a nationwide FWA launch on September 23, and its FY25E capital expenditure is expected to decrease significantly after major 5G network investments in FY24E. The wind energy entry for ROTC's renewable supply happened as anticipated.RIL highlighted Retail's top position in brick-and-mortar retailing but did not provide details on growth plans or the potential IPO timeline. The firm mentioned strong interest from global investors for Retail investments.Jefferies India anticipates reduced FY25E capex for Jio, given the substantial completion of 5G network investments. The management aims to keep net debt:Ebitda below 1x. Earnings remain unaltered due to the absence of new near-term target details. No significant new capital expenditure was revealed.Growth driversJM Financial holds the view that worries about net debt are excessive. They are confident in RIL's industry leading capabilities across various sectors, which they believe will support a strong 14-15% EPS CAGR over the next 3-5 years. JM project RIL's net debt to peak in FY24 and then decrease due to moderated capex (Rs 1.3-1.4 trillion per annum versus Rs 2.3 trillion in FY23), funded by increasing internal cash generation. RIL's commitment to maintaining net debt to EBITDA below 1x (0.9x in Mar'23) provides reassurance, it said.Motilal Oswal Securities expects the company to clock a consolidated revenue/EBITDA CAGR of 12% over FY23-25. Retail, Telecom, and new energy are poised to become the upcoming growth drivers over the next two-to-three years, given the large technological advancements and ambitious growth targets.""We value the Refining and Petrochemical segments at 7.5x EV/EBITDA, arriving at a standalone business valuation of Rs 904/share. We ascribe an equity valuation of Rs 750/share to RJio and Rs 1,485/share to Reliance Retail, factoring in the recent stake sale and an equity valuation of Rs 16/share pertaining to New energy on book value,"" Motilal Oswal's report added.Nomura said the various sectors hold a positive outlook: O2C could gain from global oil demand growth of 2.2mn b/d in 2HCY23. CDU additions slightly trail demand growth by 0.5 mn b/d. Retail growth is solid due to store expansions and operational efficiency.
