"  August 02, 2023 / 08:28 AM IST  ","After a strong rally, mutual funds pare holdings in Indian banks in June quarter","Mutual funds have cut stakes in Indian banks, including in state-run lenders, during the June quarter compared to a previous quarter after a strong rally seen in the last one year, according to the shareholding pattern data on BSE. This is the first time after four quarters that mutual funds are reducing stakes in banks.To give a perspective, among the 12 listed PSU banks, mutual funds reduced their holdings in nine lenders. The 12 private banks also saw a reduction by mutual funds.""In the June quarter, mutual funds have sold stakes in several banks – public and private – and added stakes in a few bank stocks. This may reflect their view on the valuations these stocks have reached post the rally seen over the past few months,"" said Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research, HDFC Securities.A section of analysts predict that the banking sector will experience a reduction in net profit margins in FY24. Additionally, they expect that systemic credit growth in the sector will be lower in FY24 compared to FY23. Consequently, there could be a noticeable slowdown in the overall pre-provision earnings growth of the banking system.What do numbers say?Among the PSU banks which saw a decline in mutual funds from last quarter are State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, Central Bank of India, Indian Bank, Indian Overseas Bank, Punjab & Sind Bank, UCO Bank, and Union Bank of India.Meanwhile, Bank of Maharashtra, Bank of India and Canara Bank saw mutual fund stakes going up.Notably, both State Bank of India and Bank of Baroda have been facing a consistent decline in mutual fund holdings for the fourth consecutive quarter, with reductions of 100 basis points (bps) and 200 bps, respectively.The trend was largely similar in private sector banks and non-banking finance companies as well. During the quarter, among private banks, RBL Bank, Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, City Union Bank, Karur Vysya Bank, Federal Bank, DCB Bank, Bandhan Bank, HDFC Bank, Indusind Bank and ICICI Bank witnessed a reduction in stake by mutual funds.For non-banking finance companies (NBFCs), L&T Finance Holdings, Manappuram Finance, Cholamandalam Investment and Finance, and Bajaj Finance witnessed a decrease in stakes by mutual funds.Share prices rallySince April 2022, the Nifty PSU Bank Index has climbed over 154 percent while so far this year it has risen 7.4 percent. The rally was due to the continuous robust profitability of public sector banks and improving non-performing assets with lower provisioning. The increase in credit growth among government-owned banks also helped to improve sentiments among investors.Public sector banks collectively recorded a net profit of Rs 1.05 lakh crore in FY23, with SBI and others reporting their highest-ever earnings. All PSBs posted declines in gross and net bad loans, both as a percentage of loans and in absolute terms. For the June quarter, six PSU banks reported earnings and all of them have beaten expectations, analysts said.For private sector banks, Bandhan Bank and City Union Bank gave negative returns while Kotak Mahindra Bank and HDFC Bank gained just 5 percent and 9 percent, respectively, since April 2022. IDFC First Bank is the biggest gainer surging over 100 percent followed by RBL Bank and IndusInd Bank, which jumped 71 percent and 45 percent, respectively. ICICI Bank advanced 35 percent while Axis Bank rose 22 percent during the period.Sujan Hajra, Chief Economist and Executive Director, Anand Rathi, maintains an equal weight stance on the banking sector. Hajra believes that well-managed public sector banks have the potential for a valuation catch-up, which could lead to a modest outperformance by these banks continuing in the future.FII trendsApart from mutual funds, foreign institutional investors also cut their stakes in state-run banks except SBI, Bank of Baroda, Bank of Maharashtra and Punjab National Bank, from a quarter ago. FIIs have raised stakes in private banks and NBFCs during the quarter versus in the March 2023 quarter.Meanwhile, mid-sized NBFC firms experienced interest from both FIIs and mutual funds, as they were seen buying shares of companies such as Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd, Shriram Finance Ltd, PNB Housing Finance Ltd, Can Fin Homes, Max Financial Services Ltd, and Aditya Birla Capital.EarningsSo far in the June quarter, 26 banks reported earnings, out of which 12 banks’ net profit has fallen from a quarter ago while one bank – Dhanlaxmi Bank – reported a net loss.

"  August 02, 2023 / 05:04 PM IST  ",Fitch Glitch: Investors lose Rs 3.56 lakh cr as Dalal Street joins global selloff,"Equity indices spiralled lower on August 2 after rating agency Fitch unexpectedly downgraded US’s sovereign credit rating, spooking investors across the globe and triggering a rout in world markets.After crashing 1,000 points intra-day, the BSE Sensex clawed back some lost ground to end 676.53 points or 1.02 percent lower at 65,782.78, while the broader NSE Nifty finished 207 points or 1.05 percent lower at 19,526.55.Domestic investors were left poorer by Rs 3.56 lakh crore, with the market capitalisation of all BSE-listed companies standing at Rs 303.24 lakh crore, compared to Rs 306.80 lakh crore on August 1.Fitch downgrades US credit rating to AA+: All you need to knowIn the Sensex pack, index heavyweight Reliance Industries shed Rs 18,539 crore in market capitalization, followed by HDFC Bank (Rs 15,354 crore), Tata Motors (Rs7,675.10 crore), Bajaj Finserv (Rs 7,223.41 crore) and Tata Steel (Rs 5184.25 crore).Only four counters bucked the trend – Nestle India, HUL, Asian Paints and Tech Mahindra.Fitch Ratings has downgraded the US credit rating from AAA to AA+, citing 'expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years'. The move triggered a spike in US yields on the benchmark 10-year bond to over 4 percent. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen was quick to respond to the downgrade, calling it “arbitrary” and “outdated.”Also Read: Fitch downgrade scare will be short-lived, say Dalal Street analysts“The downgrade of the US credit rating by a notch is sentiment negative for global markets. The US 10-year bond yield spiking above 4% and the dollar index rising to 102 are near-term negative for emerging markets.“But it is important to note that the downgrade doesn’t say anything that the market doesn’t know. So, the negative knee-jerk reaction will be short-lived. Globally equity markets have been rising on the US economy’s soft landing narrative. The downgrade doesn’t alter that,” said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services.Most analysts maintain the markets are experiencing a knee-jerk reaction.“Today's selling could've been a panic reaction to Fitch cutting US credit rating from 'AAA' to 'AA+'. However, if you look at June Quarter results from companies in the US and India you would be able to validate that there is economic strength in India and the USA is looking to make a strong economic recovery,” said Mayank Mehraa, Smallcase manager and principal partner at financial consultancy Craving Alpha.Over the past month up to yesterday, the Nifty was up 2.13 percent while Nifty Midcap was up 6.42 percent, making decent returns for most market participants.“In such cases most people are sitting on returns more than they expect which makes their holding extremely fragile. The linear up-trend also gives people the perception of ‘expensive valuations’. Overall, I would call this correction healthy as it would keep complacency away and keep participants on their toes about their positions and investments,” he added.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.
