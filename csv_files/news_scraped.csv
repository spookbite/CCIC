"  July 13, 2023 / 05:11 PM IST  ",Buy Ashok Leyland; target of Rs 194: KR Choksey,"KR Choksey's research report on Ashok LeylandAshok Leyland (AL) is the flagship company of the Hinduja group and the 2nd largest manufacturer of commercial vehicles in India. The company has a footprint across 50 countries and has a product range from 1T GVW (Gross Vehicle Weight) to 55T GTW (Gross Trailer Weight) in trucks. AL is benefitting from the industry tailwinds in the domestic CV market owing to government infrastructure spending, strong replacement demand and healthy traction from core industries like steel, cement and mining. Further growth is possible with the enforcement of the scrappage policy as well as increasing urbanization and replacement of Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) buses bought in FY 10-13. AL has managed to gain a market share of 4.7% in FY23 in the M&HCV Bus and Truck segment, reaching a share of 31.8%. The market share gain has been achieved despite AL raising prices, backed by better acceptance of its AVTR product platform. AL’s consistent focus on expanding its network both in MHCV and LCV businesses immensely helped in increasing its market penetration. AL is putting greater efforts into reducing costs – both product costs as well as overheads. FY23 has been a record year in efficiency improvements. Many of the initiatives started last year covering value engineering, waste reduction, digitization of manual processes, other overhead reduction etc., have yielded good results and are continued in FY’24E.OutlookWe have assigned a P/E multiple of 21x (unchanged) on FY25E EPS of INR 9.3 (unchanged) to arrive at a target price of INR 194/ share (unchanged). The target price implies a potential upside of 19.4% from the CMP.

EBIT margin declined 120bp QoQ to 17.0%, missing our estimate by a huge 140bp, despite a 2.5k reduction in workforce (-1.1% QoQ).

The seller may also offload an additional 72.39 lakh shares, representing two percent of the overall stake.The OFS, at the base offer, will fetch the yoga guru Ramdev-led entity around Rs 3,258 crore. The stake sale is being undertaken to comply with the minimum public shareholding norm of 25 percent.Catch up on all LIVE stock market updates hereAs of June end of 2023, the Promoter and Promoter Group held 80.8 percent stake in Patanjali Foods, and Patanjali Ayurved owned 39.37 percent stake.In March, the stock exchanges had frozen 292.58 million shares of promoter group entities of Patanjali Foods for not meeting the minimum public shareholding norm within the stipulated deadline.Patanjali Foods, previously called Ruchi Soya Industries, faced insolvency proceedings initiated by the National Company Law Tribunal in December 2017. Later, in July 2019, the tribunal approved Patanjali Ayurved's recovery plan for Ruchi Soya. As a result, the company's public shareholding was reduced to 1.10 percent after implementing the resolution plan.The company had said in its recent earnings call that it continues to be the leaders in the oil business with strong brands like Ruchi Gold, Mahakosh and Sunrich. Its focus remains on expanding the segment and improving margins, particularly through a model that aligns with the Atmanirbhar Bharat campaign of National Mission on Edible Oil Oil Palm.Patanjali Foods is taking steps to grow its food business too.

Revenue growth was affected by broad-based demand weakness across key verticals (BFSI) and geographies (US). The management indicated that a demand slowdown due to macro concerns is leading to reprioritization of deals, which is resulting in pauses and deferrals in non-critical projects. While the deal pipeline and deal wins (Q1 deal TCV of USD10.2b, book-to-bill at 1.4x) are good, smaller discretionary projects are getting impacted. 1Q EBIT margin declined by 130bp (to 23.2%) due to seasonal wage hikes and was in line with our estimate. The management expects margins to improve gradually over the next three quarters, in line with past trends.OutlookWe have largely maintained our FY24/FY25 EPS estimates.

The company reported operating profits of Rs 13,755 Cr with operating margins at 23.2% (a decline of 130 Bps). This was on account of wage hikes, higher visa and other operating costs. Attrition levels did drop by 220bps but they stood at 17.8%, looming concerns over the company’s execution efficiency in the future. The management commentary on the verticals BFSI, Hi-tech Media, Life Sciences, and Retail was cautious. Furthermore, it expects the company to report moderate growth in the near term.

Moreover, deal wins were spread across verticals and across geographies and stood at $10.2 Bn (BFSI TCV at $3 Bn, Retail TCV at $1.2 Bn).

"  July 13, 2023 / 09:26 PM IST  ",Clients expecting faster ROI; smaller discretionary spends postponed or stopped: Wipro CEO Delaporte,"Wipro continues to be impacted by macro challenges which are weighing on its growth. In line with its commentary from last quarter, Chief Executive Officer Thierry Delaporte said that the market has remained largely unchanged — with discretionary spends being impacted and clients focusing on cost efficiency and vendor consolidation.When it comes to verticals, the company has seen a decline of 4.3 percent QoQ in CC terms in the BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) vertical, 3.5 percent in Consumer, 1.3 percent in health, 4.9 percent in in energy, natural resources and utilities, and 0.5 percent in Communications.The technology vertical, however, grew 0.1 percent, and manufacturing at 0.9 percent.Wipro's bookings for the quarter stood at $3.7 billion, falling sequentially from last quarter’s $4.17 billion. However, its large deal TCV came in at $1.2 billion, marginally higher than last quarter’s $1.08 billion.ALSO READ: Wipro sees headcount decline for the third consecutive quarter, ends Q1FY24 with 8,812 fewer employeesAs the number of its active customers declined by 35 from last quarter, Chief Financial Officer Jatin Dalal said that the company is pivoting its business from doing tiny amounts of work for a small customer to doing “more value-added work for strategic customers,” adding that the software provider had six more customers in the $20 million deal band and two more in the $100 million-plus deal band.“...We are closing more large deals than we used to before. But at the same time, there is a reduction in discretionary spends, smaller engagements, for one quarter for two,” he said while adding that large programs are not ending and that relationships haven’t ended.“Frankly, it's really more a direct consequence of the spending pattern of our clients,” Dalal said.He added that the company’s revenue guidance of -2 percent to 1 percent for the next quarter takes into account the fact that the market could evolve in either direction.Demand environmentDelaporte said Wipro is witnessing tech investment normalise after the sharp acceleration in spending during the pandemic.“More and more clients are expecting faster returns on investments and optimising cost through increased use of automation and vendor consolidation. In parallel, we continue to see solid demand in high growth areas like cloud, mostly around cloud transformation,” he said.He, however, maintained that a lot of smaller discretionary spending has either been postponed or stopped. There also isn’t much clarity on client spending in the immediate months.""For the time being, I continue to see more or less the same market that we saw a quarter ago,” he said but added that large and mega deals are in the pipeline.“Typically, we have more of these deals in our pipe than we had two or three years ago. There are not necessarily only focusing on cost takeout, but certainly there is an expectation to drive productivity and efficiency,” Delaporte said.Consulting businessThe company has spent $2.3 billion in acquisitions since the time Delaporte took over as CEO in 2020. Capco ($1.45 billion) and Rizing are among Wipro's biggest deals.Delaporte maintained that the consulting expertise they provide is “critical”, and the acquisitions were made “completely consciously knowing that the consulting business is by definition a market that is growing fast in a growth market and slowing down in a slowing market,” he concluded.",Wipro Ltd.
