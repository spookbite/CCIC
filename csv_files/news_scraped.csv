"  July 28, 2023 / 07:17 PM IST  ","ACC’s stellar Q1 earnings fail to excite D-Street, brokerage ratings vary","Adani group-owned cement maker ACC’s strong performance on key financial metrics in Q1FY24 doesn’t seem to have impressed analysts on Dalal Street. While ACC’s announcement of the quarterly earnings in market hours on Thursday failed to induce a strong upward move on Friday as well, brokerage ratings varied from 'underweight' to 'buy'.The cement makers’ shares traded flat on Friday, having closed at Rs 1,945, up merely 0.23 percent. Intraday, the stock was seen up by 1.74 percent.ACC’s stock has seen a gradual rise from July 21 - having risen by 10.8 percent - but in year-to-date terms, it has declined by 20.28 percent.FinancialsACC on July 27 reported a net profit of Rs 466.1 crore for the June quarter, up by 105 percent from Rs 227 crore reported in Q1FY23.Revenue for Q1FY24 stood at Rs 5,201.1 crore, up by 16.4 percent from Rs 4,468 crore in Q1FY23.The EBITDA (earnings-before-interest-taxes-depreciation and ammortisation) for Q1FY24 jumped by 81 percent YoY to Rs 770.9 crore. Margins for the quarter under review were up by 530 basis points at 14.8 percent on a yearly basis.The sales volume of cement and clinker, primary revenue generators for the company, saw a 23.6 percent rise YoY at 9.4 million tonnes in the June quarter.Increase in sales volume, reduction in fuel costs and improved operational efficiency reportedly aided the company in recording strong numbers for the quarter. ACC expects the EBITDA growth momentum to continue in oncoming quarters, the cement maker said in its commentary on the quarterly results.Brokerage viewsAlthough the cement maker’s quarterly earnings have beaten the market estimates, brokerages differ in terms of their ratings.Factoring in ACC’s savings of Rs 250 per tonne on energy and raw material costs (which according to it is better than its peers) and high volume driven sales, Jefferies sees a 16 percent upside. The foreign brokerage recommends a buy and has set a target price of Rs 2,250.On the other hand, Macquarie and Morgan Stanley have rated the stock 'neutral' and 'underweight', respectively. While Macquarie’s rating is a continuation of its previous stance with the target price set at Rs 1,998 per share, Morgan Stanley expects a 14 percent downside considering weak realisations and a slight sequential decline in ACC’s cash position. Morgan Stanley has set a target price of Rs 1,650 per share.The variance in terms of brokerage ratings extends into the domestic realm as well.Axis securities has recommended a buy at a target price of Rs 2,540, seeing a 31 percent upside from the prevailing price. “We expect the company to report volume growth of 12 percent CAGR over FY23-FY25E, EBITDA/tonne improving to Rs 920 in FY25 and margins to 16 percent,” the brokerage report observed. The brokerage expects operationalisation of the Ametha unit in Q2FY24 to benefit the company.Motilal Oswal Financial Services (MOFS), on the other hand, has given a 'neutral' rating with the target price set at Rs 2,180. MOFS in its report acknowledged the cement maker’s quarterly performance having beaten its expectations. Considering the management’s guidance of sustaining the current cost structure, it expects the EBITDA figures for FY24E/25E to grow by 25%/23%. Noting that there is still a lack of clarity on ACC’s growth plans, the brokerage has decided to continue its stance considering that the stock continues to trade at attractive valuations.Sectoral outlookWhile the financial services firms and brokerages differ in their ratings, there is consensus in their demand outlook for the cements sector.Foreign as well as the domestic brokerages expect the strong demand trend to continue considering the demand from the housing segment and an increased spending on infra-projects by the government ahead of general elections.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

The margin miss was primarily due to an adverse mix of lower-end motorcycles and a lower 3W mix. Management indicated that although retail demand in key export markets is likely to have bottomed out, the lack of availability of USD for trade remains the major factor hampering export visibility. The domestic motorcycle industry continues to see weak demand and management is now guiding for 4-6% volume growth over the next few months, largely driven by the 125cc and above segments.

He said that it will have access to all the goodwill, brand assets and so on for its growth and success.The 40 percent holding was also to give some headroom for growth by bringing in some strategic investors. Later in the interaction, in answer to an analyst’s query, he said that he did not imply that there is an intention (for ITC) to exit (ITC Hotels) completely. It is “never to completely move out of it”, he said.For ITC investors’ exitOn whether the company will have any arrangement to help investors of ITC get an exit, Puri said that each investor will need to take an independent decision. “We have no arrangement with anyone (to facilitate this),” he said.“Tourism industry is in good shape and the (investor) interest in this (the new company) will be equal (to that in ITC) if not more… anybody who does not wish to be with it (ITC Hotels), market dynamics will give an exit. We won’t participate in that,” he said.On ITC Hotels’ balance sheetIn saying that ITC Hotels has access to a strong balance sheet, the senior executive said that he did not mean that the company can access ITC’s balance sheet. “It is that ITC Hotels has a strong balance sheet, starting out with Rs 6,000 crore in net assets and with no debt,” he said. With this the company can go to the market and leverage its balance sheet to raise capital, over and above the cash flows it generates, he added.On ITC’s EIH Limited holdingsPuri said that he cannot go line by line on the investments but said that all operating investments will move to the new entity.On asset-right strategyTo questions from analysts on whether the new entity will have a more aggressive asset-acquisitions strategy, Puri replied in the negative. He said that the new entity too will continue to have the asset-right strategy (not asset-zero or asset-light strategies) which is based on management contracts. “If a trophy property comes up, then the board will decide at that point,” he added.",ITC Ltd.

"  July 28, 2023 / 11:58 AM IST  ",IOCL gains ahead of June quarter earnings,"Shares of Indian Oil Corp Ltd (IOCL) gained a percent ahead of its June quarter earnings due later on July 28, with state-run oil marketer expected to post a strong set of numbers driven by a sharp recovery in margins.According to a Bloomberg poll of two brokerages, IOCL will report a profit of Rs 7,576.10 crore. Revenue is expected to be around Rs 1.91 trillion, according to six brokerages, while two brokerages peg the EBITDA at Rs 20,698.80 crore.Analysts expect IOCL to report improved operational performance due to a recovery in marketing gains with blended margins reaching Rs 9 a litre, up from Rs 3 a litre in the previous quarter. This improvement is expected despite lower Gross Refining Margins (GRMs).  Analysts estimate refining margins of $10.1 /bbl for IOCL in comparison to $15.2/bbl in 4QFY23.The Benchmark Singapore margins declined to $4.1 a barrel from $8.2 in Q4FY23, primarily because of a significant drop in diesel and ATF spreads by approximately $12.This reduction in refining spreads will be partially offset by the ongoing procurement of discounted Russian crude. As a result, though refining profits are expected to be lower, the recovery in marketing margins is likely to drive the Q1 profits after tax, analysts said.Follow our live blog for all the market action""We anticipate IOCL's EBITDA to rise 11x YoY (up 7 percent QoQ) attributable to strong marketing offset by weak refining. Marketing margins have risen sharply over the past two quarters amid falling crude prices,” Nuvama Research said in a note to investors.Diesel marketing margins are estimated at Rs 10 a litre (INR-15 YoY, INR+2 QoQ). It expects a 5 percent year on year rise in domestic retail sales this quarter, the note said.“We expect throughput to decline 2 percent YoY and QoQ. Singapore GRMs have plunged 80 percent YoY and 50 percent  QoQ. Petchem is likely to remain subdued on weak realisation YoY"", it said.Analysts said the high auto fuel over-recoveries are expected to offset the substantial decline in refining margins during Q1FY24, which is estimated to be over 50 percent lower at approximately $4.1 a barrel.Despite a sequential decline in IOCLs' GRM, they are projected to continue outperforming the Singapore complex GRM due to the advantage of utilizing discounted Russian crude oil.At 10.50 am, the stock was trading at Rs 96.55 on the BSE, up a percent from its previous close.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

However, in the previous week, the Nifty formed long upper wick candle indicating profit booking has happened at higher levels.We witnessed the lower top lower bottom formation in the Nifty Index on the daily charts for the last few days indicating a short term corrective sign.The momentum indicator RSI is declining from over bought level on the daily charts, indicating a loosing positive momentum of the Index for the short term. The index has a strong support at 19,562 (weekly low) followed by 19,230 (key support). While on the higher side, the mark of 19,991 (life high) followed by 20,200 (key resistance) are crucial levels to watch out for.The overall trend of the Nifty index looks positive till it sustains above 19,562 levels and potential upside would be 19,991 followed by 20,200 mark, however if it breaches 19,562 level on the downside then it will correct till 19,230 mark for the short to medium term.Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks:Larsen & Toubro: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,660 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,550 | Target: Rs 2,900 | Return: 9 percentThe correction in the stock of L&T took place gracefully as the stock post December 2022 did not get into the formation of Lower Highs and Lower Lows despite the overall market correction. This illustrates the positive undertone of the prices.Currently, the stock appears to be emerging from a consolidation phase, signaling a continuation of the uptrend. The breakout from this consolidation was accompanied by a Gap and substantial trading volumes, providing further confirmation of the breakout.Moreover, the prices have consistently found support at the 12-day exponential moving average (EMA), which has acted as a reliable variable support level. This reinforces the notion of an upward trend beginning to take shape.The momentum oscillator, MACD (moving average convergence divergence), has demonstrated a favourable crossover above the zero line, reflecting the likelihood of prices trending upward from their current levels.Going forward, we can expect the stock prices to move higher till the level of Rs 2,900 where the stop-loss must be Rs 2,550 on the Daily Closing basis.Escorts Kubota: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,449.35 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,320 | Target: Rs 2,650 | Return: 8 percentThe stock is currently performing at an unprecedented level, with a clear upward trajectory marked by consistent increases in both highs and lows within the established rising channel.Recently, a breakout from a Rounding Bottom pattern was noticed in the stock. This is an encouraging signal that suggests the continuation of the upward trend.When it comes to support levels, the stock prices have been reliably cushioned by the 12 & 26-day exponential moving averages (EMA), reinforcing the upward trend during each phase of growth.As for the momentum of the stock, the MACD indicator remains in a strong position well above the baseline, demonstrating the stock's sustained positive momentum.Looking forward, we anticipate that the stock prices will continue to climb until they reach the level of Rs 2,650. At this point, a stop-loss should be implemented at Rs 2,320 on a closing basis.Godrej Properties: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,707 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,610 | Target: Rs 1,950 | Return: 14 percentThe stock formed CIP (change in polarity) formation near Rs 1,000 levels in March 2023 and bounced back with the formation of Higher Top Higher Bottom on the monthly charts indicating strong positive undertone for the long term trend.On the weekly charts, the stock has given a Cup & Handle pattern breakout with volume confirmation which confirms the bullish structure of the stock. On the daily charts, the stock has been consistently moving upward with the support of 13-day EMA and sustaining at 52-week high level.Also the stock is sustaining above its important moving averages like 50, 100 & 200-day SMA (simple moving average) which shows the strong bullish sentiments of the stock.The momentum indicator RSI (relative strength index) on the weekly as well as on the daily timeframe is rising and sustaining above 65 levels reflecting presence of positive momentum.We expect the prices to move higher till Rs 1,950 level where the stop-loss must be Rs 1,610 strictly on the closing basis.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

The EBITDA margin reported in Q1 was also historically the lowest on a quarterly basis for the drug maker.At 09.22 am, shares of Laurus Labs were trading one percent lower at Rs 340.55 on the NSE.Follow our live blog for all the market actionWhat analysts are sayingMoreover, the management also retained its sales outlook for FY24 as it expects revenue expansion of base pipeline projects and 2H Animal health contract supplies kick-off in the CDMO (Contract Development and Manufacturing Organisation) business.  However, that did little for brokerages to consider it as a positive trigger for the upcoming quarters.Foreign brokerage Jefferies noted that tepid growth in the base business along with the absence of any major CDMO product should result in persisting margin pressure for the drug maker.Alongside, the brokerage also slashed its FY24-26 EPS estimate for Laurus Labs by 12-24 percent. Jefferies has an 'underperform' call on Laurus Labs, with a price target of Rs 250, which reflects a downside potential of over 27 percent from Thursday's closing price.Also Read: Laurus Labs Q1 results: Net profit tanks 88.8% to Rs 28.4 croreMargin erosionA similar bearishness was seen by InCred Equities as it cut its price target for the stock to Rs 294 to price in a downside potential of 14.5 percent from Thursday's closing level. The brokerage also retained its 'reduce' rating on the drug makers, largely on the back of a sharp margin erosion on a year-on-year as well as sequential basis. The firm also believes the current valuations of the stock are expensive, hinting that it will further cap its upside.Choice Broking also sees the drugmaker's Q1 earnings as an indication of a subdued performance through FY24. Additionally, the broking firm believes it will take immense effort from the company to come close to its FY23 performance from the current run rate. ""Further, the ongoing capital expenditure of Rs 1,000 crore will further make it difficult for Laurus Labs to generate a free cash flow in FY24,"" the broking firm mentioned in its report. Choice Broking also has a 'neutral' stance on Laurus Labs, with a price target of Rs 328.Aligned with the trend, Motilal Oswal Financial Services also cut its earnings estimate by 6 percent/3 percent for FY24/FY25 factoring in the adverse impact on Non-ARV (antiretroviral) API (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients) business, a gradual pick-up in the formulation business, and higher operational costs.However, marking a stark contrast from the consensus, MOFSL retained its 'buy' call on the stock, with a rather bullish target price of Rs 410. The firm attributed significant progress across different aspects within the CDMO segment, the limited scope of price pressure in the ARV segment, and adding customers/new products in the Non-ARV API/Formulation segment as reasons behind the positive outlook for Laurus Labs.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.
