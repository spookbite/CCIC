CV demand was quite firm in Q4 and FY 23 supported by higher influx of infra projects, mining & construction activities and above normal monsoon, which may drive demand further. New launches and focus on geographic mix seen in Q4 should help AL to further improve sales and fill in the gaps within the portfolio. LCV demand has been strong throughout the pandemic and is expected to strengthen as last mile transportation is a flourishing business, mainly driven by e-com success and new EV launch of its most successful model Bada Dost. Also, we expect AL to gain more market share given its new launches in tractor trailer and tipper segments and huge order book for trucks driven by STUs and private fleet operators. Bus demand is also going strong on pandemic fading off and markets completely opened up. Both bus and LCV demand shall get a further fillip with ongoing strong demand for their EV variants with AL’s EV arm SWITCH Mobility getting good orders and credit worth Rs2bn from the parent AL.OutlookOn the margin front, Modular program, cost cutting initiatives, lower discounting, price hikes, superior product mix along with softening input costs shall aid margin growth. To sum it up, we believe the ongoing CV upcycle to continue in FY 24 as well; albeit as a lower pace, which would result in to high earnings growth and higher valuations supported by low commodity cost benefits aiding margins. Divestment in Switch Mobility to act an additional trigger as and when and if at all it happens.

Net profit for FY23 slipped to Rs 627 crore, down from Rs 836 crore over the previous year.In FY23 the gross margins were at 64.7 percent, contracting by 160 basis points due to inflationary pressure and an unfavourable portfolio mix in the first three quarters, the statement said.Catch all the market action on our live blogHere is what brokerages have to say about stock and the company post March quarter earnings:Prabhudas LilladherBroking firm increase its EPS estimates for FY24/FY25 by 3.4%/6.5% which factors in impact of easing raw material inflation, pickup in rural demand across categories (ex of summer portfolio) and increased ad spends behind core brands.4Q results saw volume growth of 2% while summer portfolio was impacted due to unseasonal rains across India.Key categories like Pain Management and Health Care are expected to grow (after 2 years of COVID numbers in base) in FY24. Input cost pressures have come off, which gives promise for demand in upcoming quarters.Emami is investing for the future with 1) new launches in existing categories like Boroplus, Zandu and new product launches in D2C 2) investment in D2C businesses and Modern Trade 3) increase in direct town coverage to 60k (from 52k) by FY24 and 4) increasing ad-spend to gain market share.Prabhudas Lilladher estimate 19.4% PAT CAGR over FY23-25 and value the stock at 25x Mar25 EPS and assign a value of Rs 517/share (Rs 485 earlier). Retain Accumulate.SharekhanEmami delivered a muted performance in FY2023 with revenue growth in high single digit and contraction in OPM. For FY2024, the domestic business is expected to grow by 8-10%, largely driven by strong growth in the newly acquired businesses, while OPM is expected to be higher than 27%.Emami has a strong brand portfolio and its sustained focus on product launches, distribution expansion, scale-up of emerging channels, strong pipeline of D2C brands, growth in international business, and improved penetration will help to improve its growth prospects in the medium term.OPM is expected to improve in the coming years with raw-material prices stabilising.The stock has corrected by 11% in the past six months and is currently trading at 20.4x and 17.2x its FY2024E and FY2025E earnings, respectively. Sharekhan maintain 'Buy' recommendation with a revised price target (PT) of Rs 460.Nirmal BangEmami's Domestic business grew by 5% YoY in 4QFY23 (volume growth of 2% YoY) as unseasonal rainfall impacted demand for summer products., Adjusted for Dermicool and Helios mergers, which together contributed ~10% to sales in 4QFY23, volume growth declined YoY.International business grew by 19% YoY in 4QFY23, driven by growth in markets of MENA, CIS and SAARC regions. Overall net sales growth in 4QFY23 stood at 8.8% YoY.Changes to the model have led to 5.3%/1.3% cut in FY24E/FY25E EPS (before amortization). While the summer portfolio has not done well and may remain a drag in the near term, recovery in the rural market (>50% salience) could benefit the overall growth prospects.Considering the likelihood of asset monetization over the next month (and subsequent reduction in promoter pledge), along with the inexpensive valuation, Nirmal Bang assign a multiple of 25x on FY25E EPS and maintain 'Buy' rating on Emami with a target price (TP) of Rs 490.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

The management is optimistic and expects to share positive updates regarding the merger during the next earnings call.""ZEEL’s sustained investment in content, while a drag on near-term profitability, should stand them in good stead once the demand turns, as has been the case in previous cycles. Healthy OTT growth and improvement in viewership share are encouraging signs. We sense that the impending merger with Sony is shaping ZEEL’s strategy to stay on the investment course to get into a post-merger position of strength. While a few minor hurdles still remain, we believe the merger is now closed"", said JM Financial in its note to investors.ZEE5 reported revenues of Rs 740 crore, up 35% on a yearly basis, and EBITDA loss of Rs 1100 crore, up 67% in FY23. It is worth noting that the ZEE5 loss has far exceeded Hotstar’s peak EBITDA loss of Rs 600 crore.Despite increased investments in OTT, ZEE5's daily active users (DAUs) have shown slow growth in the past four quarters. Management has identified inflation in operating costs related to OTT, primarily due to investments in technology, which are expected to stabilize, and investments in content, which are anticipated to remain high. Consequently, analysts predict that ZEE5's losses will continue to be substantial, exceeding Rs1000 crore, for the foreseeable future.""We expect ZEEL to reap the benefits once ad-spends revive, and we are positive on the proposed merger. Despite strong growth, Zee5 losses continue to widen. Weak ad revenues and movie performance are areas of concern"", Nuvama said in its note. The brokerage firm has reduced its target price to Rs 265 from Rs 325 earlier. It maintained a buy rating on the stock.According to B&K Securities, the ongoing macro challenges show no signs of diminishing in the near future. The slow rebound in advertising expenditures by FMCG companies has resulted in muted revenues. Additionally, the combination of high investments in content and ongoing pressure on margins has added further strain. Despite these challenges, investments in Zee5 will continue. The theatrical performance of movies has been lackluster, and a recovery in footfall is not expected anytime soon. Moreover, sports-related activities will contribute to a decline in margins. The recovery in subscription revenues is anticipated to occur only in the second half of the year.However, FMCG companies are indicating a planned increase in advertising and promotion (A&P) spending in the upcoming quarters, which brings optimism for the revival of ad expenditures. The resurgence of FMCG ad spending, along with positive updates regarding the merger with Sony, will serve as near-term catalysts for the industry, the B&K report added. Given the elongated slowdown, the brokerage house has cut its estimates and continues to remain tactical buyers with a revised target price of Rs 236 a share from Rs 274 earlier.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

"  May 26, 2023 / 06:06 AM IST  ","Matters remotely connected with company have been addressed, Zee says on Sony merger","Zee Entertainment's merger with Sony Pictures Networks India (SPNI), announced in 2021, continues to face legal challenges. However, Punit Goenka, CEO of Zee, stated that matters remotely connected to the company have been addressed.Regarding the IDBI Bank plea, which was dismissed by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Goenka mentioned that the team is taking all necessary steps within the boundaries of the law to ensure there are no further hindrances in the merger approval. He expressed hope for positive developments on the merger front.In terms of financial performance, Zee Entertainment reported a 70 percent drop in operating revenue YoY, amounting to Rs 151.7 crore. This decline can be attributed to reduced revenue and increased strategic investments across the business. Advertising revenue also fell by 8 percent to Rs 4,057.9 crore in FY23 from Rs 4,396.2 crore in FY22.Rohit Gupta, Chief Financial Officer of Zee Entertainment, described FY23 as a challenging year for the media and entertainment industry as a whole. Weak ad spending, delayed implementation of the New Tariff Order (NTO), and underwhelming movie content affected Zee's performance throughout the year.Gupta expressed expectations for a gradual recovery in ad spends, but cautioned that it was too early to make accurate predictions. In Q4 FY23, ad spending by FMCG brands remained muted.Subscription revenue for Zee Entertainment saw a 1 percent YoY decline. The implementation of NTO 3.0 on February 1, 2023, led to a situation where some distribution platform operators (DPOs) challenged the order in court and did not sign interconnection deals with broadcasters as required.As a result, Zee had to switch off channels, adversely impacting advertising and subscription revenue. The standoff eventually ended with DPOs signing new agreements.Goenka emphasized that the industry may not experience significant growth in subscription revenue in the medium to long term during FY24, expecting only inflationary growth.ZEE5, the streaming platform of Zee Entertainment, witnessed revenue growth, reaching Rs 220 crore in Q4 FY23, compared to Rs 161.4 crore in FY22 for the same period.Goenka mentioned reports projecting 20-25 percent CAGR for the digital ecosystem over the next eight years. He highlighted Zee's doubled quarterly revenue run rate in the past eight quarters.Goenka expressed cautious optimism regarding inflationary headwinds and the benefits of NTO 3.0.Zee Entertainment also announced plans to discontinue its present business and operations, including Margo Networks, which offers internet connectivity under the brand name 'Sugarbox.' This decision is part of portfolio rationalization and aligns with the impending merger conditions, according to Gupta.",Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd.
