"  April 25, 2023 / 07:14 AM IST  ","Hot Stocks | At least 10% return likely from Aditya Birla Fashion, Bank of Baroda, Gujarat Fluorochem","On April 24, the Nifty broke out from the flag pattern on the daily chart, which indicates the resumption of an uptrend. However, last weekly candle was ended up with a bearish engulfing formation, which will be negated if Nifty surpasses 17,863 level.Last week, the Nifty reached near the crucial support of 17,500, derived from 50-day and 200-day EMA (exponential moving average). Fibonacci retracements of 38.2 percent and 50 percent of the entire upswing seen from 16,913 (low of March 28) to 17,883 (high of April 17) are placed at 17.500 and 17.388. So trend of the Nifty index is expected to remain bullish unless it breaks 17,388 on closing basis.India VIX, which measures the volatility that traders expect over the next thirty days in the Nifty, has reached at the historical lows of 11.62, which indicates extremal low volatility expected in the Nifty. A lower VIX signifies low volatility and a stable range for the asset price. India VIX at multi-year low is good for the market, as India VIX has a negative correlation with Nifty.In general, Lower India VIX = Lower Risk of Falling.Considering the technical evidence discussed above, we believe that market can continue to be stock and sector specific. Any level below 17,388 would reverse the trend from bullish to bearish. Any level above 17,900 would be considered as resumption of medium term uptrend.Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks:Bank of Baroda: Buy | LTP: Rs 180 | Stop-Loss: Rs 167 | Target: Rs 202 | Return: 12 percentThe stock price is trading within the big symmetrical triangle, which adjoins major swing highs and lows since December 2022.

Indicators and oscillators like RSI (relative strength index), MACD (moving average convergence divergence) and DMI (directional movement index) have turned bullish on daily charts.Gujarat Fluorochemicals: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,359 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,175 | Targets: Rs 3,575-3,700 | Return: 10 percentThe stock price has broken out from bullish Inverted Head and Shoulder pattern on the weekly chart.

Sequential loan accretion at 6.3% was largely led by consumer finance (+6.8% QoQ) that was attributable to MFI/CV/UV/cars. Bank laid out the PC-6 strategy as a runway to FY23-26E with targeted loan growth of 18-23% and increase in retail share to 55-60% (now 49%). Pace of retail deposit (as per LCR) accretion would be a key driver to loan growth and we are factoring a 18% loan CAGR over FY23-25E. Adding branches would be necessary for strong retail business growth, and we see cost to income at average 45.6% in FY24/25E (44.3% in FY23). Asset quality has been stable and buffer provisions are 66bps; bank would like to further build these provisions.OutlookWe expect RoE to enhance from 14.5% to 16.2% over FY23-25E. Keeping multiple at 1.8x, we slightly raise TP to Rs1,530 from Rs1,500 as we roll forward to Mar’25 ABV.

Healthy loan growth (of 21% y-o-y/ 6% q-o-q), stable NIMs, strong core fee income traction (27% y-o-y/ 8% q-o-q and a decline in provisions drove up ROA to ~1.9%. Total slippages rose by 9% q-o-q (~2.7% cal. based on trailing 12M loans annualised versus 2.6% q-o-q) mainly led by MFI segment and one corporate restructured account. However, asset quality continued to improve led by strong recoveries and upgrades along with contained write offs.OutlookThe bank is guiding for the sustained improvement in earnings growth trajectory over the next 3 years.

However, elevated gross slippages at 2.4%, primarily from MFI (~13%) and corporate book (~11%) in addition to higher credit costs (142bps) suggest that IIB is having to operate at the higher end of the risk spectrum, especially given its historically sub-par / non-granular deposit profile. Over its next threeyear planning cycle, IIB is focusing on achieving deposit granularity through its branch expansion strategy. However, we believe that IIB faces structural challenges in a deposit-constrained environment, translating into sub-optimal operating leverage from continued investments on both sides of the balance sheet.OutlookWe trim our FY24E/FY25E estimates to factor in elevated credit costs, and higher opex, offset by NIM reflation (higher mix of the fixed-rate portfolio).
