"  June 09, 2023 / 08:42 AM IST  ","Motilal Oswal upgrades DMart to buy, ups target price to Rs 4,200","Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Securities has upgraded Avenue Supermarts Ltd, owner of D-Mart chain of stores, with a buy rating from neutral earlier and increased its target price to Rs 4,200 a share, up 18 percent from its current market price.The upgrade comes after continued robust earnings, expected recovery in same-store sales growth (SSSG) amid easing inflation and cheap valuations.In the last five years, DMart has traded at 60x EV/EBITDA and 99x PE. The stock currently trades at 58x price earnings multiple and 36x EV/EBITDA after correction in the stock of nearly 25 percent since September 2022, which represents a 30 percent discount to historical multiples. The correction was due to weak SSSG in the recent past and Motilal expects that it will improve in fiscal 2024 should boost valuation multiples.Motilal expects a likely recovery in SSSG driven easing of general inflation, coupled with a reduction in raw material costs and implementation of new store strategy to address the issue of smaller 30-35k sq ft stores. Since FY19/20, the company has been opening larger stores, which continue to contribute to SSSG even after completing their initial 3-4 year cycles. This is likely to enhance store productivity, with potential for increased footfall growth.The brokerage expects post SSSG recovery, strong cost control could help DMart improve its margin by 30-50 basis points or pass on the gains to drive higher offtake. Despite weak SSSG, DMart has managed to protect its EBITDA margin, unlike other retailers, which have seen a 200-450bp margin hit."" We believe DMart’s SSSG and earnings revision cycle are closer to bottoming out. Tailwinds from robust store additions and consistent cost efficiency could play a key role in SSSG recovery. Subsequently, we estimate a revenue/PAT CAGR of 27%/29% over FY23-25"", Motilal Oswal said.Motilal is of the opinion that worries surrounding the emerging online grocery market are unnecessary. This viewpoint is supported by the fact that both online and modern retail account for a tiny portion of the overall grocery market. Consequently, the market presents a vast potential for growth and opportunities.""DMart has grown its revenues and earnings at a robust CAGR of 23 percent and 24 percent over the last five years. After growing the topline at this scorching pace and achieving a turnover of Rs43,000 crore, it has just about scratched the surface in our view. We believe it has a long runway for growth as the modern retail space is still in its infancy in India"", Motilal report added.",Avenue Supermarts Ltd.
"  June 09, 2023 / 06:51 AM IST  ","Burgers over pizzas, Jodhpuris over casuals: Mixed consumption trends rule Q4","The Q4 earnings reports of Indian FMCG majors reveal divergent trends in consumer spending. In this regard, broking firm Jefferies in its recently released analysis of management comments of 40 major Indian consumer companies and disclosure of their individual demand figures has noticed mixed trends across segments.According to the report authored by Vivek Maheshwari, Jithin John and Kunal Shah, while the premium consumer segment comprising premium apparels, jewellery and paints reported double-digit growth, most of the other mass oriented companies reported weak to moderate demand trends.“Recovery seems to be underway across mass customer segments and low-tier geographies, but a rebound may take time, and would likely be visible during 2HFY24,” the authors further observed. While the individual management commentaries differed in their reasoning for tepid growth, they were unanimous in observing that although decline in inflation levels had considerably brought down input costs, it hadn’t necessarily helped pick up consumer demand to the expected levels.This has been particularly noted in the management commentaries of Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) majors like Jubilant Foodworks, the operator of popular pizza chain Domino’s and Devyani International Foods which operates popular fast food brands like Pizza Hut and KFC. The former two along with popular dining chain Barbeque Nation have reported Q4 demand in red but expect to tide over the situation by the end of the second half of the first quarter in FY24.Interestingly, while Pizza selling majors have seen a slump on various fronts such as declining Same Store Sales Growth (SSSG) due to aggressive store addition policy and reduced margins, other QSR majors popular for burgers such as the Burger King operator Restaurant Brands Asia (RBA) and Westlife Foodworld, operator of McDonald’s for western and southern India have disclosed having received strong demand in Q4FY23 and are confident of being in green in the coming quarters of FY24.Also read: FMCG stocks under pressure on El Nino uncertainties flagged by RBI governorThe Jefferies report also notes that while aggressive store additions may not have worked in favour of QSRs, pursual of the same has turned out to be a major growth driver for multi-category retail majors like DMart and Reliance Retail. The latter in particular has reported a strong 66 percent growth year-on-year (YoY), driven by grocery sales through its outlets like Reliance Smart Point while the outcome for DMart has been a mix owing to weak demand for mass apparels and other Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) which constitute a major chunk of its inventory.In the context of multi-category retail, it is also worthwhile to note that barring Dabur and Emami which are in red, for most FMCG majors the demand continued to be moderate. Authors point out that most of the staples producers like Nestle, Varun Beverages and Tata Consumer Products Limited's brands like Tata Tea were acquiescent of the fact that the net demand was being driven by increasing consumption in rural areas. However, the report also notes that the response from the rural consumer base hasn’t been the same for mass footwear brands like Relaxo and Campus which have reported demand contraction in this geography.Contrary to the conditions faced by mass oriented brands, demand for premium consumer goods manufacturers and brands remained relatively stable. Among the apparels segment, while overall demand for the commodities of Page Industries (Indian manufacturer of American brand Jockey), Aditya Birla Fashion and V-Mart remained in red, wedding apparel brand Manyavar’s owner Vedant Fashion along with fashion retail major Shoppers Stop and GoColours registered strong growth in FY23Q4.In the jewellery segment, Tata’s premium watch maker and owner of jewellery brand Tanishq along with south Indian major Kalyan Jewellers reported high growth, with the latter having reported 18 percent revenue growth YoY driven by strong demand coming from the non-south. Similarly, riding on the strong 48% surge in housing sales and enhanced government spending on infrastructure, all major paint and adhesive companies reported revenue growth in green with Asian Paints reporting 13% growth YoY along with a strong demand driven 16% volume growth.The management commentaries in ressonance with the observation of several analysts also observed that the demand and subsequent revenue growth forecast continues to be vulnerable to external factors. The Jefferies report in this regard observed that sustained easing out of inflation for keeping the input costs in check along with climatic factors like El Nino could play an important role in deciding the growth trajectory of the FMCG segment in coming quarters.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.
