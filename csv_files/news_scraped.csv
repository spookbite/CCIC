"  February 22, 2023 / 09:59 AM IST  ","Prestige Estates edges higher as Jefferies retains 'buy' tag, predicts 30% upside","Jefferies has maintained its positive outlook on Prestige Estates Projects and set a target price of Rs 550 per share, indicating a potential upside of over 30 percent from the current market price of Rs 420.30 as of February 22.At 9:42am, Prestige Estates Projects traded at Rs 421.30, up Rs 6.25, or 1.51 percent, on the BSE. It has touched an intraday high of Rs 421.75 and an intraday low of Rs 415.50.Jefferies' analysis of the company's recent analyst meet suggests that the company has successfully expanded into a challenging yet promising market.""The management aims to double the residential sales and multiply lease income by seven times in the next five years. Its existing residential pipeline is projected to generate significant free cash flow over the next few years, of which 40 percent will be used to fund lease and hotel capex. The remaining capex will largely be debt-funded, leading to an increase in debt levels.Catch all the market action on our live blogJefferies' analysis suggests that Prestige Estates Projects has demonstrated its ability to execute and scale up its operations with successful expansion in Mumbai. The current strong residential upcycle in the market should support Prestige's efforts to scale up its residential business, although the company is a leader in this space.Office demand is weak due to a slowdown in tech hiring but, with about 50 percent of its lease income to come from non-IT, the company's supply is well-distributed.Jefferies also notes that the projected scale of capex/debt increase can benefit from risk reduction and/or a benchmark equity infusion in the business. The research firm believes that Prestige's excellent execution track record, expansion to different geographies, should help it overcome challenges as it enters a new asset creation cycle. Additionally, Jefferies suggests that the market may underappreciate the quality of Prestige's residential business.The company's consolidated net profit surged 45.2 percent to Rs 127.80 crore in Q3 FY23 as against Rs 88 crore reported in the same period last year. Revenue from operations surged 74.5 percent year on-year to Rs 2,317 crore in the quarter ended December 31, 2022.Also read: Sebi seeks details on Adani Group firms' loans and securities from rating agenciesThe realtor reported profit before tax of Rs 232.10 crore, up 65.7 percent from Rs 140.10 crore in Q3 FY22.During the quarter, total expenses spiked 75.39 percent to Rs 2,113.5 crore.

On the upside, 18,000 will be an immediate and critical hurdle.Bank Nifty has failed to break through the 42,000 level and has fallen below the 40,800 support level.

On the upside, 41,100 will act as a strong hurdle.The Put/Call ratio below 0.75 and FIIs' short exposure in index futures at 78 percent indicate an oversold market, but the market ignores overbought and oversold zones in expiry week.The market is watching the geopolitical situation, the movement of the dollar index, and US bond yields, while the flow of FIIs will be another important factor in market direction.Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks:Zensar Technologies: Buy | LTP: Rs 293 | Stop-Loss: Rs 260 | Target: Rs 340 | Return: 16 percentThe counter is bottoming out after a meaningful correction, and there is a breakout of an Inverse Head & Shoulder formation, which is a sign of a bullish reversal.It was able to close above its key moving averages while displaying positive divergence in the RSI (relative strength index).
