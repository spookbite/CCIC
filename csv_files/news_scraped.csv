"  February 09, 2023 / 10:15 AM IST  ","Adani Group shares fall following MSCI's review of its free float, Adani Enterprises drops 15%","Shares of Adani Group companies began trading lower on February 9, following a two-day recovery. The drop was prompted by MSCI’s announcement of a review regarding the number of Adani Group-linked shares that are readily available for trading on public markets.All 10 stocks of the Adani Group faced a decline, with the leading company, Adani Enterprises Ltd, experiencing a significant drop of up to 15 percent. The decline followed a substantial increase of 35 percent in the previous two days.The other group stocks that witnessed decline are — Adani Ports lost 7 percent, Adani Power fell 5 percent, Adani Transmission 5 percent, Adani Total Gas Ltd 5 percent, Adani Green Energy 5 percent, ACC declined 3.7 percent, Ambuja Cement 6.3percent and NDTV 3.7 percent.MSCI announced that any changes to the free float and market capitalisation of Adani Group stocks, which will impact the calculation of these figures, will be implemented and announced as part of its February index review, set to be released on February 9.Analysts said If MSCI reduces its weightings, it could lead to further selling in Adani Group stocks, as exchange-traded funds and index funds that use the MSCI as a benchmark will have to adjust their portfolios.Abhilash Pagaria of Nuvama Research noted that if MSCI hypothetically reduces the float by 25 percent, Adani Enterprises would experience an outflow of $110 million. He also mentions that ACC and Ambuja, recently acquired by the Adani group, should not be a cause for concern regarding float concerns.The stocks of the group experienced a strong resurgence in the last two trading sessions with Adani Enterprises witnessing a surge of 35 percent after dropping over 55 percent due to accusations made by US-based short seller Hindenburg Research. The research firm accused the Adani Group of “stock manipulation and accounting fraud,” causing the conglomerate’s market capitalisation to plummet by over $117 billion.The two-day surge in stocks was triggered by the company’s announcement to pay off $1.11 billion in loans on shares ahead of their due date in 2024. The move was met with enthusiasm from investors, who were also encouraged by supportive statements from some lenders regarding the stability of Adani Group companies. Additionally, the group’s recent earnings reports further boosted investor confidence.",ACC Ltd.

The Adani group has denied the charges but the group stocks have been hammered in the aftermath of the report.Follow our live blog for all the market actionA strong quarterAdani Wilmar's October-December quarter net profit came in at Rs 246 crore, while consolidated revenue from operations was at Rs 15,438 crore, growing 7 percent on-year.On the operating front, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) jumped 20.2 percent year on year (YoY) to Rs 605.3 crore.

While all other Adani stocks are a part of the MSCI India index and are staring at the possibility of their weightage being reduced, Adani Wilmar is not part of the index yet.MSCI said on February 9 that certain investors in Adani Group securities should no longer be designated as free float, and it is reviewing this status. The changes will be announced later in the day.Any reduction in the weightages of Adani group stocks could trigger another selloff, as exchange-traded funds and index funds benchmarked to MSCI will rejig their portfolios. Adani Wilmar and NDTV are not part of the MSCI India index.Clarification on GST raidsGoods and services tax (GST) officials reportedly searched Adani Wilmar’s warehouse at Parwanoo in Himachal Pradesh on February 8.Soon after, the company came out with a statement that it was a ""routine inspection and not a raid"". ""The officials did not find any irregularities in the operations and dealings conducted by the company,"" it said.""The concerns specific to GST payments in cash, citing GST law under Rule 86B, the company is not required to pay tax liability in cash,"" it added.Brokerage viewAnalysts remain bullish on the stock. ""Although Adani Wilmar competes in an extremely competitive business (edible oil and foods/FMCG), it has consistently delivered strong volume growth across segments,"" said Nuvama Institutional Equities in a results update.It noted that strong demand on the back of festivities and weddings, gradual recovery in rural markets and a bumper kharif crop acted as tailwinds in Q3.The firm has a ""buy"" rating on the stock, with a target of Rs 680 apiece.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Technically the stock has been consolidating and moving within the Budget day's range of Rs 114-125 for fifth straight session, especially after correction of 20-24 rupees in earlier few sessions. Also it has been trading well below short term and long term moving averages.The housing finance company will announce its December FY23 quarter earnings next week on February 14.Ambuja Cements remained in F&O ban for yet another session.

Any increase in open positions shall attract appropriate penal and disciplinary action,” the stock exchange said.During the ban, traders are not allowed to take fresh positions in stocks but can start reducing their positions. The F&O ban rule helps reduce speculation in stocks.The market-wide position limit, which is set by stock exchanges, is the maximum number of outstanding open positions (buy and sell) in the F&O contracts of a security. If the open interest in a stock crosses 95 percent of the market-wide position limit, its F&O contracts enter the ban period.Normal trading in a security resumes only after the aggregate open interest across exchanges comes down to 80 percent or below the market-wide position limit, the NSE said.",Ambuja Cements Ltd.

"  February 09, 2023 / 08:10 PM IST  ","Zomato Gold crosses 900K members in a month, will not hit profitability plans","As Zomato has faced some challenges recently, the food delivery platform is banking on its newly launched Zomato Gold membership program to help it wade through tough times. The new scheme has found many takers.Zomato said it has already onboarded over 900,000 members within a month of launching the membership program in January. The reinvented scheme is already in its fourth iteration and has been the centre of controversies in the past. The key highlight of Zomato Gold is ‘On Time Guarantee’, said Zomato. Gold members also get priority access to more restaurants during peak times and offers from a number of restaurants on both delivery and dining-out.Zomato said the plan will have a negative impact on revenue in the short term. However, it is confident that other streams of revenue will make up for the loss.ALSO READ: Zomato Q3 loss widens to Rs 347 crore, revenue jumps 75% YoY“The short term negative impact of Zomato Gold (due to free delivery benefit) will be offset by improvements in other revenue and fixed & variable cost drivers,” said Akshant Goyal - Chief Financial Officer - Zomato. “In the long term, we believe we will be able to make the Zomato Gold program itself profitable.”Though some analysts have pointed out that this plan may increase challenges for the company, Goyal believes the ambitious plan will not derail Zomato’s target of reaching adjusted EBITDA break-even (ex-quick commerce) by Q2FY24.“As far as investments by way of Zomato Gold are concerned, they were already baked into our projections, as the launch of Zomato Gold has been in the works for several months now,” he said. “The current slowdown in demand was unexpected which is impacting the growth in food delivery profits but despite that, we think we are in a good position to meet our profitability goal.”The company added that its business has already hit break-even (ex-quick commerce) in January 2023 and there is a good chance of getting to Adjusted EBITDA break-even (ex-quick commerce) in the current quarter if it is able to bank some execution related wins in the next few weeks.Goyal said this should offset the negative impact of Zomato Gold on the company's margins.",Zomato Ltd.
"  February 09, 2023 / 08:06 PM IST  ","Zomato CEO on recent top-level exits: Sometimes, it's necessary to take break","The difference between people’s mindset and skill vis-a-vis a company’s context makes it necessary to take a break from each other, said Zomato Chief Executive Officer Deepinder Goyal.This statement from the CEO features in the company's Q3FY23 shareholders’ letter on the spate of top-level exits the company has seen recently. Zomato saw four top-level exits in the span of two months — between November 7, 2022, and January 2, 2023.“Company building is not just about the journey of the business. It is also so much about its people’s personal journeys. Both these journeys take their own twists and turns. And sometimes, for some people, the distance between their form (their mindset and skillset) and the company’s context becomes such that it is necessary to take a break from each other,” he said.“I attempt to stay true to a culture where I expect every individual, including me, to continuously learn and grow, improve upon their form, and adapt to the changing context. Also, without hope, but not hopelessly, I think that most of our people who have exited haven’t really left. People leave their roles at Zomato, but Zomato never leaves them,” he said.He claimed that several senior leaders are in their second or third stint at the company. “They did that once the company’s context changed, or when they changed their form. Sometimes, both. All of this works for us wonderfully. The entropy our people create in the organisation by leaving and then coming back is fantastic, to say the least, and propels the organisation forward,” he added.The first top exit Zomato saw was in the first week of November 2022, when Siddharth Jhawar, a vice-president at the company who was in charge of Zomato Legends, the company’s intercity food delivery service left. Jhawar joined ad-tech unicorn Moloco to run its India operations. Blinkit director Kamayani Sadhwani took over this position.A week later, it was Rahul Ganjoo — who used to head food delivery and later headed new initiatives. Ganjoo, who had joined the company as a head of project development and by 2020 was co-CEO of food delivery left the company after a five-year stint.That same week, co-founder Mohit Gupta resigned. Gupta joined in 2018 as the head of food delivery, and then elevated to co-founder in 2021 to oversee new businesses. Gupta had joined Zomato from MakeMyTrip, where he was the chief operating officer.Two days into the new year, Zomato informed the stock exchanges that Chief Technology Officer Gunjan Patidar, who was one of the company’s earliest employees, had quit.On the exit of Ganjoo and Patidar, Goyal said that the company doesn’t “have the need to fill these two spots”.“..being on ‘continuous lookout for great talent’ is an attack tactic, not a defense tactic,” Goyal said.Ahead of the results, Zomato’s stock closed at Rs 54.60 apiece on the National Stock Exchange, up by 0.55 percent. The scrip has shed 42 percent during the last one year and is trading below its issue price of Rs 76.The company, which reported its results for the third quarter of the fiscal on February 9, saw its losses widen to Rs 347 crore, from Rs 251 crore reported in the preceding quarter. Its revenue from operations stood at Rs 1,948 crore, up 17 percent sequentially.",Zomato Ltd.

It declined 1 percent sequentially which the company said was due to an industry-wide slowdown in the food delivery business since late October (post the festival of Diwali)Contribution margin (as a percent of GOV) improved from 4.5 percent in Q2 to 5.1 percent in Q3. The food delivery adjusted EBITDA grew significantly to Rs 23 crore compared to Rs 2 crore reported in Q2FY23. The EBITDA loss for food delivery in Q3FY22 stood at Rs 221 crore.""The improvement in Contribution in Q3FY23 was largely driven by growth in AOV plus efficiencies on the cost side which more than compensated for marginally lower customer delivery charges,"" said Akshant Goyal, Chief Financial Officer, Zomato.GOV for Blinkit, which Zomato acquired in August last year, grew 18 percent QoQ to Rs 1,749 crore while the revenue grew 28 percent.

The food delivery platform is expected to post a 68 percent on-year jump in revenue from operations but losses might widen, according to brokerages.At 10:15 am, the stock was quoting at Rs 56.10 apiece on the National Stock Exchange, higher by 3.3 percent.

""Losses will expand sequentially on account of full quarter consolidation of Blinkit (versus 50 days of consolidation in 2Q),"" it noted.That said, co-founder Deepinder Goyal's tweet has infused some enthusiasm among investors. On February 7, he congratulated Vijay Shekhar Sharma on achieving operating profitability way ahead of guidance. Sorry, a bit late to the party – was so busy working on our own profitability ;-) Goyal tweeted.Last month, the stock took a knock after reports said that it will be discontinuing its 10-minute food delivery offering, Zomato Instant. But, the company clarified that it will be 'rebranding' Instant and not discontinuing it.The stock is down over 7 percent in 2023 so far.
