"  January 31, 2023 / 10:37 AM IST  ",L&T beats estimates with 24% surge in Q3 net: What should you do with the stock now?,"The share price of Larsen & Toubro (L&T) declined on December 31, a day after company announced its December quarter results.Larsen and Toubro on January 30 reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 2,553 crore for the December quarter of 2022-23, up 24 percent from the year-ago period. Revenue from operations zoomed to Rs 46,390 crore, 17 percent above the corresponding quarter last year.However, its operating margins contracted to 10.9 percent from 11.4 percent a year ago. The infrastructure player explained that the drop in margin was mainly due to merger integration costs in LTIMindtree and higher staff cost in services portfolio.At 09:36 hrs, Larsen & Toubro was quoting at Rs 2,077.25, down Rs 37.35, or 1.77 percent on the BSE.Catch all the market action on our live blogHere is what brokerages have to say about stock and the company post December quarter earnings:Prabhudas LilladherThe brokerage house maintained the 'buy' rating with target price of Rs 2,481.It revised estimates by 0.6 percent/0.8 percent/3.2 percent for FY23/24/25, led by execution pick-up, healthy order book (Rs 3.9 trillion), likely margin revival in core business, improving Hyderabad metro performance and improved working capital to sales ratio.The company is well-placed to benefit from overall diversified tender prospects with (1) better order conversion in domestic market, (2) significant traction in capex from oil exporting countries mainly in hydrocarbon segment and (3) expected uptick in private capex, the brokerage said.JefferiesThe research firm has maintained the ‘buy’ rating on the stock with a target at Rs 2,650 as the Q3 EBITDA was in-line with expectations.The order flow growth was strong, driven by domestic demand, while the management maintained order flow and revenue growth guidance and seemed confident in meeting the upper end or exceeding it on order flow.Jefferies believes that the company should benefit from execution and margin recovery, reported CNBC-TV18.SharekhanThe brokerage house maintained the 'buy' rating with a revised price target of Rs 2,455 per share.The third quarter performance for FY2023 has been below expectations as the street was expecting margin improvement, given the decline in commodity cost, it said. Further, a cut in margin guidance for the core business may hurt investor sentiments in the short term.The international outlook is also buoyant, given a healthy order pipeline and emerging opportunities in non-oil segments as well, it said. ""The company remains the best proxy for domestic capex with price line.ICICI Securities L&T remains the best way to play the capex recovery theme in India given its strong execution capability, presence across diverse sectors and geographies, believes ICICI Securities.“Focus on monetisation of non-core assets, improving RoEs (Return on Equities) and reducing debt make it an attractive portfolio bet to ride the infrastructure and manufacturing cycle revival theme,” the domestic brokerage firm added.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

"  January 31, 2023 / 12:56 PM IST  ","MC Interview | These 5 stocks look lucrative on higher degree charts after bloodbath, says this technical chartist","""We believe 17,470-17,420 would act as a strong support zone in the near term and if the mentioned support zone is protected we anticipate a pullback towards 17,800-18,200 on the Nifty50,"" Rohan Shah of Stoxbox says in an interview with Moneycontrol.After the recent bloodbath in the markets, the Head of Technical Research with over eight years of experience feels there are a couple of stocks that denote a solid chart structure and look lucrative on the higher degree charts, which are expected to do well in the future.""We are optimistic on Ashok Leyland, Max Healthcare, Supreme Industries, IRCON, and Apollo Tyres,"" Shah says. Excerpts from the interview:Do you expect the Nifty to break 200 DEMA (day exponential moving average) as well as 200 DMA (day moving average) in the coming days or will there be a sharp pullback, especially after the recent turmoil?Post sharp selloff last week and the breakdown below the key support level of 17,800 all eyes are now glued on 200 DEMA (of 17,550) which is designated to be the last ray of hope for the bulls. In September 2022, the index had corrected 7.5 percent from a swing high and formed a bottom near the 200 DEMA (16,750).A similar price action has been observed now; so far the index has plummeted 7.4 percent from the recent swing high (18,888) and currently, it is placed around 200 DEMA. Also, near the same juncture, the index has a support of 38.2 percent retracement level of its prior whole advance from 15,183 to 18,888 and 50 WEMA (weighted exponential moving average), which is placed around 17,470 and 17,420, respectively.Thus we believe this zone to act strong support zone in the near term and if the mentioned support zone is protected we anticipate a pullback towards 17,800-18,200.As we have seen a bloodbath on Dalal Street, which are the potential multi-baggers to buy now?Technically, there are a couple of stocks that denote a solid chart structure and look lucrative on the higher degree charts. They are expected to do well in the future and one should follow a buy-on-dips approach with a time horizon of 8-12 months.To name a few, we are optimistic on the following stocks: Ashok Leyland, Max Healthcare, Supreme Industries, IRCON, and Apollo Tyres.Do you think the Bank Nifty will hold the 40,000 mark or will it get broken decisively?Analysing the short-term and medium-term charts, we perceive the Bank Nifty has significant support a few points below 40,000, i.e. at the 39,700-38,800 zone.Around this territory, the banking index has a confluence of support which includes reciprocal AB=CD Harmonic Pattern, 200 DEMA, and a cluster of Fiboannic retracement lines. Hence if the mentioned support zone is validated, we sense an oversold bounce cannot be ruled out.India VIX moved closer to 200 DMA now. Do you expect the VIX to cross the high of September 2022?There seems to be a low probability of the VIX index surpassing the high of September 2022. From the level perspective, the VIX index has a key resistance around the 20-20.50 zone; till that is not taken out, the VIX index is expected to trade in a broad range from 12-20.What should be the best strategy to follow in such kind of environment?Staying with the leaders would be the best strategy to follow. To pick the stocks from the universe which have relatively outperformed the benchmark index, stocks that have managed to hold 20 DEMA, solid chart structure and stock prices continue to form progressive higher highs and lows. Apart from technical parameters, traders must follow their trading plan, disciplined in following stop loss and targets.As per your technical studies, which is the best trading (technical) pattern that works in such a fall as well as in an uptrend?Being an ardent follower of Harmonic Patterns, I use different Harmonic Patterns, primarily to project potential reversal zones, trend reversal, and trend continuation. Harmonic Pattern is an advanced concept in technical analysis that was introduced in 1999 by Scott Carney. These patterns are derived by applying different Fibonacci tools, ratios, and techniques.They unveil unique trading opportunities with a favourable risk-to-reward setup. Like price patterns, there are different Harmonic Patterns such as AB=CD, Gartley, BAT, Crab, Butterfly, Cypher, etc. Among other patterns, I extensively follow AB=CD Harmonic Pattern, which is easy to spot and accurate in spotting reversals and momentum.Will the Nifty Auto index hit a record high in February?The index witnessed renewed buying interest over the past few weeks after the index reversed retesting the neckline of the multi-month Cup and Handle price pattern. The momentum indicator continued to stay strong.Despite a sharp selloff in the broader market, the Auto index managed to close the last week higher by 3 percent, which clearly denotes the inherent strength. Thus, there is a high probability that the Nifty Auto index is likely to hit a record high in February.What does the February series look like?There are two major events lined up this week, India's Union Budget and US Fed's first policy meeting in 2023, which will set the tone for the markets in the near term. However, we would be closely following the levels discussed earlier and will approach the market accordingly.If the mentioned support zone in Nifty & Bank Nifty is protected there is scope for the pullback. Among the sectors, NiftyPharma, NiftyAuto, NiftyFMCG, and NiftyIT are expected to do well in the February series.Any three stock picks for short term?Berger Paints: Sell |  LTP: Rs 540 | Stop-Loss: Rs 565 | Target: Rs 470 | Return: 13 percentThe price action on Berger Paint continues to deteriorate whilst trading in stage 4 of corrective phase and is already trading below the 200 WEMA and 61.8 percent. The price action further plummeted below the crucial polarity trendline and a pivotal support in the week gone by.The relative strength and performance as compared to Nifty is trading with a negative slope over the last 7 months which is not a good sign. The RSI too is trading with a lower high and lower low sequence since it peaked in January 2021 which indicates dearth in strength of the price momentum.InterGlobe Aviation: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,094 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,000 | Target: Rs 2,265 | Return: 8 percentThe price action on the daily timeframe has staged in a Cup and Handle schematic. It is currently hovering a pivotal support Rs 2,070.The major moving averages have a positive slope which indicates bullish biasness, it is relatively outperforming the benchmark index of Nifty which dictates strength in the stock. The RSI is consolidating near the media and the MACD is trading in the positive territory.The price action has immediate support at 20 DEMA trading at 2074 levels and it is anticipated to attract further bullish momentum on sustenance above the same.Sun Pharma: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,043 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,005 | Target: Rs 1,125 | Return: 8 percentThe price action on the daily time frame is trending in the direction of its prior bullish pattern breakout of rounding bottom. It saw decent profit taking from 52-week high level and the intermediate corrective trend resulted in the formation of bullish reversal harmonic pattern of ABCD. It is now bolstered by a pivotal support.The pharma stock displays stronger relative performance as compared to the head index of Nifty the trending momentum shows strength by means of RSI scaling above 60 levels. Hence we reiterate a bullish bias in the pharma stock.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

"  January 31, 2023 / 10:46 AM IST  ",Vedanta is said to scrap plans to sell mega Indian copper smelter,"Vedanta Ltd. has shelved the plan to sell its copper smelter in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, which accounted for almost 40% of the metal’s production in the country, and has doubled down on its efforts to restart the plant, according to people familiar with the matter.After scrapping the seven-month-old process to offload the 400,000 tons-a-year Sterlite Copper plant, the company will now work with the local population to restart the factory that was shut on environmental concerns, the people said, asking not to be named as the information is not public.Vedanta’s petition to lift a local government order to close the plant will be heard by the Supreme Court on Feb. 21.Restarting the smelter will lead to a surge in India’s copper output and cut imports. The refined metal is poised to play an important role in the nation’s shift toward electric vehicles and renewables and has lured interest from billionaire Gautam Adani’s group, which has the ambition to become one of the largest copper producers in the country.India “can’t afford to close this plant permanently when the demand for copper is at its peak in the country,” a spokesman for Vedanta said in an emailed statement, replying to a query on it scrapping the sale process.“There has been a positive sway among the people of the region with more voices coming forward to support the reopening of the plant.”The company, controlled by billionaire Anil Agarwal was working with Axis Capital Ltd. to sell the assets and had invited bids from prospective bidders in a newspaper advertisement in June.The smelter has been closed since 2018 on orders from the state government following the death of more than a dozen people when police opened fire on villagers protesting pollution from the facility.India had turned a net importer of the metal for the first time in almost two decades following the plant’s closure, Vedanta’s spokesperson said.",Vedanta Ltd.
