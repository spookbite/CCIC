Ashok Leyland’s (AL) 1QFY24 EBITDA margin at 10% (-c100bps QoQ) beat PL estimates on the back of cost reduction efforts, lower discounting, higher non-CV mix and inventorisation. AL aims for double digit EBITDA margin in FY24 (has started on a strong note to achieve it), which gives us confidence in its medium term targets of reaching mid-teen. Further 1QFY24 volume performance was impacted from pre-buying in 4QFY23, but demand should improve from 2QFY24 given MHCV segment is benefiting from strong infrastructure development and growth in other end-user industries. We believe AL is well placed to sustain its FY23 market share gains led by 1) strong demand for modular AVTR trucks, 2) network expansion and 3) new product launches. LCVs will benefit from filling of white space, growth in end markets and network growth. Also, price hike, benign commodity price, cost control and operating leverage will lead to margin expansion (EBITDA margin +c300bps over FY23-25E).OutlookMaintain ‘BUY’ at target price of Rs 225 (previous TP Rs. 215) on Mar-25E EV/EBITDA of 13x (includes ~Rs 12 for HLF).For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

"  July 26, 2023 / 10:16 AM IST  ",Brokerages predict gradual export recovery for Bajaj Auto but some headwinds sit in the way,"Bajaj Auto delivered a healthy performance in the April-June quarter, however, that didn't seem enough for brokerages to change their stance on the automaker. Even though brokerages do expect better times for Bajaj Auto in the coming quarters, they also pointed a few headwinds that may derail the growth trajectory for the auto company.Brokerages took notice of the signs of a recovery in exports, most anticipate it to happen gradually over the ongoing fiscal year. On the flipside, an inferior mix which resulted in a 30 basis points drop in Bajaj Auto's EBITDA margins to 19 percent from 19.3 percent in Q4FY23 also remained a common sore point for most brokerages.Also Read: Bajaj Auto Q1 results: Net profit rises 42% to Rs 1,665 crore; revenue up 29%Foreign brokerage Morgan Stanley, which has an 'overweight' call on Bajaj Auto along with a price target of Rs 5,063 also anticipates gradual export recovery for the company. The firm also sees a scale-up of electric vehicles (EVs) and the company's Triumph motorcycles in the domestic market as the key monitorables for Bajaj Auto. In addition, Morgan Stanley is also overweight on the two-wheeler segment where Bajaj Auto is a dominant player.On similar grounds, domestic brokerage Motilal Oswal Financial also expects  both domestic and export volumes to recover in FY24 from the low base, which it believes will driving healthy earnings recovery for Bajaj Auto.The firm also predicts that Bajaj Auto will benefit from market share gains over the long term, driven by the premiumization trend, opportunity in exports, and the potential sizeable position in the scooter market through EVs.Despite that, MOFSL also highlighted that a large part of Bajaj Auto's India profit pool (comprising premium motorcycles and three-wheelers) is vulnerable to possible disruption from electrification.Moreover, the broking firm feels Bajaj Auto's current stock valuation fairly reflects the expected recovery as well as the risk from EVs but its dividend yield of 4.5-5.0 percent should support the scrip. MOFSL has a 'neutral' stance on the Pune-based automaker, with a price target of Rs 5,150.Follow our live blog for all the market actionOn the other hand, while Nuvama Institutional Equities also ascribed to expectations of a gradual recovery but it pegged it on the economic conditions and dollar availability in African and Asian markets.Regardless of that, the brokerage firm said it expects Bajaj Auto to underperform peers such as TVS Motors, owing to its weak presence in scooters in the domestic market and its large exposure to overseas markets.Moreover, even though the firm chose to raise its target price for the stock by 4.5 percent to Rs 5,100 to bake in an uptick in FY24E/25E EPS by 6 percent each, higher realisations, it still retained its 'hold' rating.On the other hand, Kotak Institutional Equities is concerned over the impact of rising competition in the economy motorcycle segment for Bajaj Auto. The firm believes that a rise in competitive intensity within the segment will weigh on Bajaj Auto’s entry segment portfolio.Moreover, KIE also believes two-wheeler segment export volumes have bottomed out, but unavailability of the US dollar and currency devaluation in Nigeria remain areas of concern. ""Though the company’s profitability has improved significantly in FY23 mainly owing to a richer product mix, we do not expect the current profitability to sustain, as we expect demand from Africa to recover from the second half of this fiscal and strong growth in electric 2W sales,"" KIE mentioned in its report.Aligned with MOFSL's view, KIE also believes the current valuation of Bajaj Auto, especially after its over 13 percent gains in the past three months, factors in its upside potential. On that note, the firm retained its 'sell' rating for the stock, with a price target of Rs 4,350.Amidst the dark clouds of ifs and buts around Bajaj Auto, investors also chose to remain on the sidelines. As a result, shares of the automaker did not react strongly to its earnings and at 10.08 am were trading 0.5 percent higher at Rs 4,871.94 on the NSE.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

EBITDA margins, on the other hand, benefited from operating leverage QoQ, price hikes, lower EV mix and inventorisation and expanded c30bp QoQ to 10.6%. We expect margins to further benefit from low raw material prices in the subsequent quarter, while exports volume should see sequential improvements.

Recently, the stock formed a base above the 21-day EMA, setting the stage for a significant consolidation breakout.In yesterday's session, the stock surged by 6 percent on impressive volumes, confirming the breakout. As a result, investors are advised to maintain their positions in the stock as long as it remains above its previous swing low at Rs 1,280-level.For traders, holding or considering additional positions is recommended on a follow-through above Rs 1,385-level. Setting a stop loss at Rs 1,340-level will help manage risk effectively while capitalizing on potential upside moves.Overall, TVS Motor looks promising for both investors and traders given its positive price action and strong underlying trend.ThermaxThe stock has undergone a prolonged consolidation phase for almost a year. In the recent trading session, a significant breakout occurred both in terms of price and time. This breakout is evident in the formation of a Cup and Handle pattern, typically considered an accumulation pattern.Although the stock's liquidity is relatively low, the breakout was accompanied by robust volumes, indicating potential buying interest from stronger market participants.As a result, the stock is anticipated to advance towards Rs 3,000-level in the near future, assuming no unfavourable developments arise in its upcoming financials scheduled to be presented on 1st August. Investors should keep a close eye on the company's financial performance during this time.HEGHEG has been enduring a sustained downtrend for several years. However, from February 2022 to June 2023, it went through a period of steady consolidation. Post June 2023, the stock displayed strong momentum and successfully broke above a downwards sloping trendline on significant trading volumes.Analyzing the weekly chart, we can observe the formation of a Flag and Pole Pattern, with a potential breakout level at Rs 1,700-level. If the stock manages to break out above Rs 1,700 with convincing volumes, it is likely to trigger a substantial rally, targeting levels of Rs 2,200 and Rs 2,500.It is important to note that the critical support for the stock is identified at Rs 1,550-level.

                    ",Tata Steel Ltd.
"  July 26, 2023 / 11:51 AM IST  ",First 2 quarters have been tough but too soon to give up on debt reduction goal: Tata Steel MD,"The first two quarters have been more challenging than expected for Tata Steel, but the company is not giving up its target of reducing debt by $1 billion in fiscal year 2023-24, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer TV Narendran told Moneycontrol in an exclusive interview.The Tata group steekmaker’s net profit plummeted 93% in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023-24, dragged by its Europe business, which reported negative earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) for the third consecutive quarter.Narendran reiterated that the company will spend Rs 16,000 crore on capex in FY24, driven by India demand.Excerpts from the interview follow:Tata Steel’s consolidated net profit plummeted 93% in the first quarter of 2023-24. Many brokerages had expected you may report a loss in the quarter and may have been surprised by the improvement in realisation.What was behind the Q1 numbers?The expectation was that we will report a loss because we had guided that we will be completing the transaction on the British Steel Pension Scheme (BSPS) and will have to recognise some losses on that account. That’s where the analysts had assumed that we would be negative, but we had some positives as well. The performance, particularly in India, has been reasonably good despite the challenging environment. So, even after you take out the one offs, we have delivered numbers that are better than what people had expected. The volumes have been strong in India. The weakness in prices internationally is reflected in the pricing in India as well. In Europe, we have had some challenges. We had guided that the blast furnace in the Netherlands was down for relining; only one of the two blast furnaces were operational for six months. Our numbers are significantly lower than last year because last year Q1 was a period when steel prices were quite high and coal prices were not yet that high. What we were consuming was not high-cost coal. It was also the quarter when the export duty was brought in by India. There were abnormal circumstances in Q1 of last year, so it may not be a good base for comparison. This is the third consecutive quarter of losses in Europe operations. There are macro factors affecting the demand there and you have undertaken relining of blast furnaces in the Netherlands, which is affecting production.How is this looking for the rest of the year?We give European numbers on a consolidated basis. But if you look at our performance for the last 8-10 years, typically, the Netherlands business is positive in cash, EBITDA and PAT (profit after tax). It is a pretty strong business. The UK is where we have struggled because structurally there are some challenges. The assets are old and coming to the end of life. Often, the Netherlands business offset the losses in the UK business. On a consolidated basis, you tend to see a positive EBITDA more often than not. But last year, because of the Ukraine-Russia conflict, gas prices and electricity prices in Europe shot up significantly in a short period. Secondly, the demand recovery was taking time because of the overhang of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. It was a pretty tough year in Europe. On top of that, we had the blast furnace relining so the Netherlands business has not been able to contribute on a consolidated basis and in fact has negative EBITDA in Q1, which is very unusual. That’s why you see three quarters in a row, Europe operations had negative EBITDA.The challenge will continue for Q2 as well because the blast furnace is still being relined; it is a five- to six-month process. We will see a positive recovery in the performance of the Netherlands only from Q3; by Q4 it will be back to normal.The UK business tends to make money when steel prices are good, if not, it tends to have a negative EBITDA. That’s always been the challenge with the UK business. Over the years, we have shrunk the UK business from 10 million tonnes to 3 million tonnes and the India business has grown to 20 million tonnes. So, while UK business was 40 percent of our business at one time, it is now 10 percent of our business. That’s why Tata Steel, on a consolidated basis, is in a much stronger place. Going forward, the Netherlands business will come back to normal and will hopefully be able to offset the UK, which will swing between positive and negative EBITDA.What’s the outlook for demand?India demand continues to be okay, driven by a strong auto industry. Construction demand in Q2 tends to be a bit soft as construction activities slow down in the monsoon season. Overall, in India, the demand is quite strong, which is reflected in the fact that we are running at 100 percent capacity utilisation and selling 95 percent of that in India. Globally, demand is going to be driven a lot by what happens in China. The recovery in China has not been as great as expected. The stimulus that has been given so far, which is going to the real estate sector, is more to spend on completing projects than starting new projects. Though I see that in the last couple of days, there has been a little bit more excitement about another stimulus coming to the real estate sector in China.Europe will slowly recover. Next year will be better than this year from a macroeconomic point of view. In Europe and in the US, inflation is still on the higher side. The Fed, the European Central Bank, the UK Central Bank — there are talks of more rate hikes. I think it will be next year before you really see economic activity come back strongly in Europe. But we are positive about India. That’s where most of our growth is going to come from.What’s the outlook for price and realisation in the second quarter and for the rest of the fiscal year?We have guided that Q2 realisations in both Europe and India will be lower than Q1. In India, it will be about ₹3,100 per tonne lower in Q2 than Q1. In Europe, we are expecting it to be about €38 pounds per tonne lower in Q2 than Q1.At the same time, we expect the costs of coking coal consumption to come down by at least $50-55 in both Europe and India. To some extent the drop in prices will be offset by the drop in coking coal costs. We are looking at some other costs to try and protect margins.So to that extent, what kind of EBITDA per tonne are you expecting for your consolidated operations and your India operations, if you can give some colour on that for the second quarter?We don’t give specific guidance on EBITDA; there are many other moving parts. We expect H2 to be much stronger than H1 for multiple reasons. We expect that China exports will reduce in H2, which will bring more stability to international steel prices. The India demand post monsoons should be strong, leading up to the elections. Europe will progressively start getting better. Inflation is slowly coming under control. Globally, interest rate hikes will stop. So, overall, we expect a better H2 than H1 for sure.You have been talking to the UK government for support for your plant there. Now there are some reports suggesting you are internally looking at an exit plan. Where do you stand vis-à-vis the conversations with the UK government? Because they are happening at the very top level... Is there an exit plan or are there other options?The conversations have been going on for some time as you said, but we must also consider the fact that we have had three governments in the UK in the last two years and there was a lack of the political stability needed to take these calls. But now, we are seeing clear progress. Dedicated teams are working on it with us. We want to take it to its logical conclusion, which we hope will be acceptable to all stakeholders. All other speculation is very hypothetical.Have you set a hard stop for the timeline because the process has been going on for a long time?We have already said publicly that many of the assets in the UK are coming to the end of life; this is going to start happening within a year. This means we have no option but to close them — you can’t run them if they are not safe. We have a year to take a call on that. We are hoping that in the next few months, we will come to some sort of conclusion. But the outside timeline is what you said, the end-of-life of the assets,Your capex is driven by India demand. What makes you so bullish about India?Traditionally India had consumption-led growth. Over the last few years, we are seeing more investment-led growth. That’s good for steel; in this industry, the intensity of growth is higher when it is investment-led growth. Most developing countries have a steel consumption growth rate that is higher than the GDP (gross domestic product) growth rate. Even when China was growing at a GDP growth rate of 10 percent, steel consumption was growing at 15 percent. In India, it has been the other way around; steel consumption has grown slower than the GDP growth rate.That’s changing. Now, we are seeing steel consumption growing at a faster rate than the GDP growth rate, as it should. And that gives us the confidence that demand in India will continue to be strong. Prices will vary with international prices. But we are one of the lowest cost producers of steel in the world. Even if you see last quarter, the EBITDA margin in the India business is over 20 percent. And this is when steel prices are quite low and overall, most steel companies are not doing so great. So, I think we have the confidence that we are in a good cost position, we have the confidence that demand in India will grow. And we have a very strong franchise in the marketplace with our retail business, our brands, our relationship with OEMs (original equipment manufacturers), our dominant or strong position in auto and other high-end sectors. That’s why we want to keep growing in India and that helps the overall Tata Steel balance sheet and the overall Tata Steel portfolio.Earlier in the year, Tata Steel had said that it plans a capex of Rs 16,000 crore for 2023-24. Is it on track? How are you financing it?We are on track; we spent Rs 4,000 crore in the first quarter alone. Most of it will go towards completing the Kalinganagar project and the associated work. We have the internal cash flows to support that. We are also focused on our debt.So, last fiscal you slashed your debt reduction target. Then the company indicated that it will resume its deleveraging exercise and reduce debt by $1 billion in FY24. Where do we stand on that plan right now?Ever since we said that we will reduce debt by $1 billion every year, we have done it every year apart from last year. This year, of course, the first two quarters have been more challenging than we thought. But still, we have not given up on that target. I think we can manage a good balance between deleveraging and growth because of the strong cash flows out of India. It’s too early to give up on the debt reduction target.Tata Steel’s focus has been on brownfield expansion but there are some opportunities in the secondary market, like NMDC and some assets of Vedanta. Are you keen to look at that space?At the moment, we are focused on our organic growth because in the last few years we did more inorganic growth. This has given us sites on which to work on. So, between the Neelachal Ispat Nigam’s Kalinganagar site and the Bhushan Steel site — both of which we acquired — and Jamshedpur, we can actually build about 40 to 50 million tonnes on these sites. We have said we want to build 40-million-tonne capacity by 2030. Now, it’s more about execution than anything else. We don’t really need to look at any inorganic growth opportunities, we will stay focused on what we have.Decarbonisation is a big theme globally, especially in energy-intensive sectors like steel manufacturing. Carbon taxes will kick in soon. This is happening at a time when there are challenges in the macroeconomic situation and commodity cycle. How hard is it to be on track with your decarbonisation plan?The transition needs three stakeholders to play their role. One is the industry — we need to plan capex for the transition. Second, the transition needs the regulatory environment to support that. If I take Europe as an example, which is in some sense ahead of the rest of the world on the regulatory environment, there is a policy framework that includes the carbon border adjustment mechanism, which is aimed at encouraging local steel companies to transition into a greener future. The carbon border adjustment mechanism says that anybody who is selling steel in Europe has to pay the carbon tax. Then, third, you need to have customers who are willing to pay a premium, because green steel comes with a premium. Any geography which wants to transition, needs the industry to commit and do what it has to do, the government to create that framework and the environment, and customers (to be) willing to pay more. The plans are being made for both the Netherlands and in the UK, using all these elements or ingredients.In India, I think we are moving in that direction. A lot more needs to be done on a policy basis. We need to also have customers willing to pay more for green steel; I can hear some customers talking about it. As an industry, we need to invest in it, which we are already doing. There is no silver bullet. There will be multiple solutions that we need to develop and scale up. It is going to be a very exciting phase which will create a lot of opportunities. It is also going to create a lot of demand for steel, because all new energy sources also have steel in some form or the other involved in generating or transmission or storage of energy.You are juggling many balls right now. The Tata Steel board has reappointed you for another five years. As you start a new term, what is your biggest goal for the next term?Execution, both in execution of transformation in Europe and execution of growth in India.",Tata Steel Ltd.
"  July 26, 2023 / 09:36 AM IST  ",Tata Steel sees no dent in brokerage ratings despite poor show in June quarter,"A host of brokerages retained their ratings on Tata Steel Ltd despite weak earnings in June quarter. At 9.36am, the stock was trading at Rs 120.15 on BSE, up 0.7 percent from its previous close.There was no dent in the ratings by brokerages like CLSA, Ambit Capital, Centrum Broking, Citi, Macquarie, JM Financial and Motilal Oswal Securities.Tata Steel reported a 95 percent decline in net profit as its Europe operations reported a loss for the third consecutive quarter due to higher coking coal cost, lower realisation and inflationary pressure.Profit in the quarter was also dented by a non-cash deferred tax charge on account of buy-in transactions at British Steel Pension Scheme. With this, the insurance buy-in of British Steel Pension Scheme has been completed, successfully de-risking Tata Steel UK.As a result, the potential one-time cost in case of a decision to close the UK operation will be significantly lower, estimated at less than $1 billion. Such a move, if implemented, is expected to positively impact the perception of Tata Steel, potentially leading to a re-rating of the company, analysts said.""In our view, the completion of insurance buy-in at TSUK derisks the operations significantly and can be a key catalyst and enabler of changes in the UK operations model. While Netherlands operations (within historical profitability range) are expected to get back on track by H2FY24, UK operations might still lag,"" ICICI Securities said in a note to investors.The Tata Steel management on a concall indicated that it is engaged in discussions with the British government, particularly as the UK steel-making assets are reaching the end of their useful lives. The management expects clarity in this regard by end of FY24, which might entail additional cost for ushering in structural changes in the UK operations model, analysts said.The company's consolidated net debt increased by Rs 3,600 crore on-quarter to Rs 71,400 crore mainly due to capital expenditure of Rs 4,800 crore.In an exclusive interview with Moneycontrol, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer TV Narendran said second half of the year will be better but Europe may see economic rebound only next year. Narendran said the company is optimistic about strong steel demand in India and is on track for its planned capital expenditure of Rs 16,000 crore for the year.""We believe the domestic business will perform well in the near-term considering the fall in coking coal prices and expectations of a demand recovery globally in 2HFY23; however, Tata Steel Europe will take some more time to become EBITDA positive as production is impacted due to BF relining at the Netherlands,"" B&K Securities said in a note to investors.In the June quarter, Indian operations surpassed expectations in 1Q, but steel prices weakened amid a global demand softening and plummeting raw material costs. Analysts anticipate a Rs 1,500 increase in 2Q Indian operation EBITDA/tonne compared to 1Q, driven by lower coking coal prices. However, ongoing market weakness and BF relining are expected to sustain Tata Steel Europe operating level losses.",Tata Steel Ltd.

However sequentially, it is expected to decline from the consolidated revenue of Rs 13,718 crore clocked in the preceding quarter Q4 FY23.“We expect TechM to report -2.3 percent QoQ decline in constant currency and -2 percent in USD -- driven by overall weak macro, lower tech spend and Q1 seasonality,” analysts at Nuvama Institutional Equities said in a note to clients.It also expects margins to decline by 110 bps QoQ -- mainly due to wage hike, Q1 seasonality and decline in revenue.The company’s EBITDA margin stood at 11.2 percent in the preceding quarter and 11 percent in Q1 FY23.“Deal wins are expected to be modest, and so is the overall outlook,” it added.Choppy WatersForeign brokerage Jefferies expects Tech Mahindra's 1Q revenues to decline by 1.5 percent QoQ (in constant currency terms), impacted by weakness in the communication vertical, seasonal weakness at its subsidiary Comviva and overall macro weakness.“EBIT margin to decline by 150 bps QoQ due to revenue decline and wage hikes. Deal wins likely to be soft similar to last quarter,” it added.Tech Mahindra had posted a 26 percent decline in consolidated net profit for the March quarter of 2022-23, while revenue from operations stayed flat on a sequential basis and up 13 percent on-year.In a note, Kotak Institutional Equities said Tech Mahindra is likely to post a sharp 3 percent QoQ decline in revenues in the communications vertical and flattish revenues in enterprise segment.“Revenue decline in communications vertical is due to seasonal weakness in Comviva and ramp down by a large telecom client. Of particular focus will be weak top five client billing,” it noted.Revenue decline will likely feed into margins.“We build in EBIT margin decline of 40 bps on a sequential basis due to decline in Comviva margin. Lack of leverage from growth is the key headwind. Utilization levels are maxed out and will provide limited tailwinds,” the domestic brokerage added.Dismal growth, guidance downgrades, declining headcount: How Indian IT majors fared in Q1Analysts said the overall weak global macro and slow decision-making will likely feed into muted deal wins.In such a scenario, the focus will shift entirely to turnaround initiatives and margin expansion strategies of CEO- Designate, Mohit Joshi, Kotak said.The brokerage added that other key factors to watch will be the near-term growth outlook given by the firm, timing of divestments of low-margin businesses, health of deal pipeline and outlook for revenue growth in top telecom clients.Most IT firms have posted lacklustre numbers for the June quarter, impacted by the recessionary headwinds in Europe and US – the bread-and-butter markets for the domestic IT players.“We expect macro-related uncertainty, likely slowdown in tech spends and supply-side pressure to impede growth in the near-term at least in 2 more quarters,” brokerage Ashika said in a recent report.The top five Indian IT companies (by market capitalisation) have seen their sequential revenue growth on a constant currency basis at anywhere between -2.8 percent and 1 percent, a far cry from the high single-digit and double-digit growth seen last year. The biggest shocker, however, was Infosys’ sharp guidance cut for the year from 4-7 percent to 1-3.5 percent.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.
