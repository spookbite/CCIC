This removes the overhang of RoE dilution in the merged entity. 2) For PSL, RBI permitted ANBC to be computed on 1/3rd of loans of HDFC Ltd. in the 1st year post merger with the remaining 2/3rd being considered over next 2 years equally. Hence merged entity would not incur any PSL cost in FY25E resulting in core PAT upgrade of 2%. 3) Bank has to comply with CRR, SLR and LCR requirements. Hence, dispensation in terms affordable housing bonds may not be available, which would increase CRR, SLR needs albeit minimally. NIM impact would be insignificant.OutlookBasis existing valuation of 2.6x core FY25E ABV, stock trades at a 13% premium to ICICIB.

Core credit cost & net slippages were almost negligible, which was a key major positive. The bank currently has contingent provision buffers of 1.3% of loans. Deposits growth marginally outpaced loan growth q-o-q, which was also a key positive. Loan growth remained healthy and was broad-based, up 19% y-o-y and 5% q-o-q.

Edited excerpts of an interview:Is the market looking for a trigger to break out on the higher side? Do you expect the Nifty at 18,000 next week?The Nifty has faced resistance of 17,860-17,940. We had expected some profit booking from those resistance zones. After the March expiry, we have started witnessing a bounce back in the Nifty from lower levels of 17,000. The rally has given almost 800 points in Nifty reaching up to 17,860 levels.The level of 17,860 is Nifty's 100 DMA (day moving average), which acted as a resistance. If Nifty's weekly closing is below 17,570 levels, which is its 200-DMA, then the Nifty will test 17,200-17,000 levels.The Bank Nifty is consolidation above 42,000. Is it getting ready for a record high in the coming weeks?After the March expiry, we have started witnessing a pullback rally from 38,840 levels. Yes, the Bank Nifty is consolidating between 41,750 and 42,640. Once the Bank Nifty gives a closing above 42,640, it can test 43,500-43,700 levels.Do you think Nifty IT has already bottomed out, considering the leading five stocks in the pack?Nifty IT is already at its oversold zone of 26,180. It tested the same level twice from the last year and we have seen a good bounce back from those levels and this is the third time this index has tested the same level.On the contrary, if Nifty IT breaks 26,200 levels then the next support zone would be 25,200. But we are expecting a good bounce-back rally if Nifty IT manages to sustain above 28,580 levels and then it can rally towards 32,000.Yes, all the leading 5 stocks have witnessed a sizeable correction and a bounce back is expected. The stocks would be Infosys, TCS, Wipro, Cyient and Tech Mahindra.Do you think money can be made in midcap and smallcap IT stocks more than in the largecaps in the coming months?Yes, money will be made in both midcap and smallcap IT stocks. But we have witnessed a strong correction in the largecap stocks and we feel major money will be made in the largecap IT stocks as compared to smallcap or midcap IT stocks.Do you see momentum in Nazara Technologies and should one start betting on the same?Nazara Technologies is looking very positive at the current level of Rs 565. It has formed a double-bottom formation on its weekly charts and it can reach upt o Rs 800 levels in the coming weeks.Also, the stock has given a breakout of its downward-sloping trendline on its weekly charts. The stock is consolidating well on its monthly charts, too, which is a positive sign.It has given a strong breakout of its 50 & 100 DMA on its daily charts as well. Plus, we have also seen a positive RSI (momentum indicator) crossover in its oversold zone. Hence, we are positive on this stock from this quarter.What is your take on Borosil Renewables?Borosil Renewables is positive. In its weekly charts, the stock has given a strong breakout of its downward-sloping trendline and we have also seen a rising volume in this stock which will act as a positive sign for Borosil Renewables.This stock can reach up to Rs 660 levels in the coming weeks.

Also on an intraday basis, it has taken a support at 200-day EMA (exponential moving average - 17,530), while on the higher side, it has faced resistance at the 17,700 levels.These levels are expected to be crucial for further direction of the Nifty50 going forward and, if the index manages to hold 17,500-17,600 area, then 18,000 can be a possibility in coming sessions, experts said.""Amid the price-wise correction in the market, the chart structure construes optimism, and it is highly anticipated to continue the cheerful run in the upcoming week,"" Osho Krishan, Senior Analyst - Technical & Derivative Research at Angel One, said.As far as levels are concerned, he feels that till the index firmly withholds the pivotal support of 17,500, there is no sign of caution in the market, whereas on the higher end, 17,700-17,800 holds stiff resistance and a decisive move beyond which could trigger the next leg of rally in the comparable period.Mitesh Karwa, research analyst at Bonanza Portfolio, also feels the Nifty50 is expected to trade with a bullish-to-sideways bias in the coming week as the bulls are absorbing every dip in the market.

Since then it has since entered a corrective mode that lasted for 18 months, indicating the completion of the correction and a fresh start.Depending on the formation, the stock may move towards Rs 500 and Rs 600 levels in the next 6 to 12 months. The strategy should be to buy between Rs 410 and Rs 390 levels.The current momentum will fade if it breaks Rs 370 level, which should be the stop-loss for the positional trade.Cochin Shipyard: Buy | LTP: Rs 488 | Stop-Loss: Rs 465 | Target: Rs 550 | Return: 13 percentThe stock is forming a Pole and Flag formation on the daily chart.

But in last couple of months, prices have seen a gradual upmove and have started forming a ‘Higher Top Higher Bottom’ structure again.Paint stocks usually have an inverse correlation with crude prices and since the latter is showing signs of correction in the short term, it should lead to a positive impact on this sector.Hence, positional traders can buy this stock around current market price of Rs 585 for potential targets of Rs 605 and Rs 628. The stop-loss for long positions should be placed below Rs 565.Pidilite Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,440 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,380 | Target: Rs 2,540 | Return: 4 percentPost a price-wise corrective phase, the stock consolidated in a range in last few weeks.

RNEL is a wholly-owned subsidiary of RIL.However, the scheme presently pending with the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Mumbai Bench for approval, has now been decided to be withdrawn.Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani had in 2021 announced the conglomerate’s ambitions to recast itself increasingly as a clean energy enterprise, powered by huge investments as it braces for a new future.Ambani had revealed the plans lined up to pursue RIL’s clean energy goals, which will entail an investment of Rs 75,000 crore over three years. For its clean energy initiatives, RIL will invest over Rs 60,000 crore over the next three years and invest an additional Rs 15,000 crore in value chain, partnerships and future technologies, including upstream and downstream industries, Ambani had said in the annual report for FY22.Meanwhile, shares of Reliance Industries on April 21 closed 0.14 percent higher at Rs 2,348.90 apiece on the BSE.On April 21, India's biggest company in terms of valuation reported net profit, attributable to the owners of the company, at Rs 19,299 crore for the March quarter of the financial year 2022-23, up 19 percent from the year-ago period.
