As a result, all major technical trend indicators such as MACD (moving average convergence divergence) and ADX (average directional index) are strong and steady.Therefore, upward movement from the current level is very likely to continue in the coming horizon. Unless it is trading below Rs 3,100, positional traders can retain an optimistic stance and look for a target of Rs 3,450.Graphite IndiaOn a broader timeframe, the stock had been in a prolonged downtrend. Therefore, it is currently into an oversold territory and reversed from its demand area.The texture of the chart formation and technical indicator RSI (relative strength index) is indicating the current reversal formation could lead to a new leg of the uptrend from its demand zone.In the near term, Rs 267 would be the immediate support zone for the stock. Above the same, the upward rally could continue towards Rs 300 level.Welspun IndiaThe stock is trading into a rising channel pattern after reversal from the lower levels and forming the higher lows series continuously on the daily scale. The strong bullish momentum suggest that the counter is likely to maintain bullish continuation chart formation in the coming horizon.For traders, Rs 77 would act as an important support zone while Rs 86 could be the key resistance area for the short-term traders.

However, higher fees including TPD and lower credit cost led to in-line profitability, at Rs120bn (up 20% YoY). Overall credit growth for the bank was moderate, at 17% YoY/6% QoQ, due to some pulldown in retail credit growth (21% YoY) during 4Q, with its portfolio share at 46%. However, deposit growth came in strong (Rs1.5trn) at 21% YoY/9% QoQ, after a sub-optimal growth in 3Q on the back of healthy retail deposit growth in the run up to the merger. Overall NIM stood at 4.3% in 4Q, but the recent deposit acceleration may keep NIMs in check as the full impact is yet to play out. We have slightly cut our FY24E earnings, by 1%, factoring-in the elevated costs, but expect the standalone bank to deliver a superior RoA/RoE of 2%/17-18% over FY24-26E.

A detailed analysis of the numbers indicates that consumers are restraining from making discretionary purchases.However, the core retail sales (excluding auto and gas) declined less than anticipated during March. Despite the weaker retail sales figures and lower inflation prints (CPI and PPI), the markets are now pricing in an 80 percent probability of a 25bps hike in May's policy, up from the previous week's 70 percent, according to analysts.This shift in market expectations is due to remarks made by Fed member Waller, who expressed support for tightening measures in the battle against inflation. As a result, the probability of a 25bps rate hike during the May meeting has been revised higher.Surge in Covid CasesInvestors are also worried over the recent spate in fresh Covid cases.

"  April 17, 2023 / 12:53 PM IST  ","Motilal Oswal initiates coverage on Zomato with ‘buy’, sees 30% upside","Domestic brokerage Motilal Oswal has initiated coverage on Zomato with a “buy” rating and a target price of Rs 70, implying a 30 percent potential upside from the current price of Rs 54.It says the company will gain from the relatively early stage of the food-delivery ecosystem in the country amid supportive factors like growing internet penetration, rising consumption and urbanisation.The brokerage expects India’s food delivery market to clock a rapid 19 percent CAGR over FY23-25 (v/s slowing growth in other markets) fuelled by growth in the number of transacting users and order frequency.“This should lead to a higher share of online food ordering (24 percent by FY25E from 13 percent in FY21),” its analysts said in a report.With the exit of Amazon, the food-delivery market is now a settled duopoly. Gurugram-based Zomato has a market share of 55 percent and Bengaluru-based Swiggy 45 percent, its analysts said.The market has a very high moat, given the significant capital required to displace the incumbents.“We expect Zomato to report a strong 29 percent revenue CAGR over FY23–25 fueled by: a) higher penetration, b) higher proportion of transacting users, and c) increased ordering frequency,” analysts at Motilal Oswal said.Also read: MC Long View | Is Zomato’s path to profitability coming at the cost of growth?Revenue from Hyperpure (36 percent CAGR between FY23-25E) and Blinkit (27 percent CAGR between FY23-25E, adjusted for full FY23) is also likely to remain strong for the next few years as the company expands its operations, it said.Profitable by FY25Zomato acquired the quick-commerce start-up Blinkit in August 2022. Hyperpure supplies everything from meat and seafood to fruits and vegetables to restaurants.With Zomato’s food business recording EBITDA breakeven in 1Q FY23, the brokerage expects the company to turn profitable over FY25.Catch all LIVE stock market updates hereZomato's consolidated net loss for the third quarter of FY23 widened to Rs 347 crore from Rs 63 crore in the same quarter of the previous year.Adjusted Earnings Before Interest Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) loss increased 38 percent sequentially to Rs 265 crore but narrowed by 3 percent from the year-ago quarter.“Continued spends due to elevated competitive intensity from Swiggy (unlisted) should weigh on Zomato’s operating costs in FY24, making it difficult to breakeven,” it added.The brokerage also sees gross margin improving to 33.5 percent in FY25 from 5.3 percent in FY22 as the employee cost and other expenses decrease as a percentage of sales.It’s crowded out thereRegarding quick commerce, Motilal Oswal said at $5.5 billion, the segment forms just 1 percent of the grocery market of $620 billion.With a large addressable market at $45 billion, it is all set to surge 10-15x by 2025E, according to Redseer.“Though Blinkit is scaling up well and improving on profitability, we see the space as still nascent for Zomato given a large number of players in the ecosystem,” the report said.Also Read: Blinkit permanently shuts down some dark stores amid delivery workers' strikeBlinkit, attrition worriesZomato is back with its loyalty program Gold after discontinuing Pro Plus in August 2022. Given the experience of previous loyalty programs, this should help Zomato compete on more equal terms with Swiggy, Motilal Oswal said.However, it flagged the acquisition of Blinkit as an additional risk and said high attrition at the senior management level remains a concern.It also views the limited distinction between Zomato and Swiggy’s offerings – both have food delivery, dine-in and quick commerce – as an overhang.At 12.41 pm, the stock was trading at Rs 53.25, down 1.1 percent on the National Stock Exchange. The benchmark indices were off the day’s low but were still trading almost a percent lower from the previous close.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol are their own and not those of the website or its management.
