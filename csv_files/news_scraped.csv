Returns are based on the July 20 closing prices:Expert: Viraj Vyas, CMT, technical & derivatives analyst - institutional equity at Ashika Stock BrokingGlenmark Pharma: Buy | LTP: Rs 740 | Stop-Loss: Rs 710 | Target: Rs 830 | Return: 12 percentThe stock has undergone a robust base formation since its decline in 2018, and recently, it achieved a breakout above the 2018 high. This breakout is noteworthy as 2018 marked the top for mid and small stocks, and historically, breaking above 2018 highs has often led to substantial moves of around 10-15 percent in stocks.Considering the strong base formation and impressive price action after the breakout, the stock appears to be a compelling choice in the pharma sector.Federal Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 137 | Stop-Loss: Rs 132 | Target: Rs 160 | Return: 17 percentThe stock exhibited a robust rally from May to November 2022, spanning approximately 30 weeks, followed by a period of sideways trading. During this phase, the stock formed lower highs while finding consistent support in the Rs 125 - 120 zone, resembling a Descending Triangle pattern.The consolidation phase also lasted around 30 weeks, and currently, the stock is showing signs of a potential breakout, supported by above-average volume participation.Ashok Leyland: Buy | LTP: Rs 175.7 | Stop-Loss: Rs 165 | Target: Rs 200 | Return: 14 percentSince 2018, the stock has gone through a tumultuous journey, witnessing significant fluctuations in its price. In September 2022, the stock revisited its all-time high level, and rather than facing a substantial pullback, it displayed a shallow retracement before ultimately surpassing the crucial Rs 167 mark in July 2023.This breakout above the 2018 highs, combined with the stock's massive base breakout, presents a highly enticing opportunity for investors, making it an appealing choice for a lucrative buy.The underlying bullish momentum and positive price action further reinforce the potential for this stock's upward trajectory.Expert: Pravesh Gour, senior technical analyst at Swastika InvestmartJupiter Wagons: Buy | LTP: Rs 197 | Stop-Loss: Rs 180 | Target: Rs 224 | Return: 14 percentThere is a classical bullish setup as the counter has witnessed a breakout of Bullish Flag formation with strong volume.

On the upside, Rs 214 and Rs 224 are immediate target levels, while the 9-DMA (moving average) of Rs 180 is an immediate support level below which Rs 177 is the next demand level.Pitti Engineering: Buy | LTP: Rs 412 | Stop-Loss: Rs 385 | Target: Rs 470 | Return: 14 percentThe counter is in a classical uptrend and now it has broken an ascending triangle formation to resume its uptrend. The breakout coincides with rising volume and it manages to sustain above the breakout level.It is trading above its all-important moving averages with a positive bias in momentum indicators. On the downside, Rs 385 will act as a strong support level.Linde India: Buy | LTP: Rs 4,594 | Stop-Loss: Rs 4,350 | Target: Rs 5,144 | Return: 12 percentThe counter is trying to come out of a long consolidation with strong volume and witnessed a breakout of the triangle pattern. The overall structure of the counter is very Classical on the daily chart. The pattern suggests an immediate target of Rs 5000, while it has the potential to move further upside to Rs 5,144 level.On the downside, Rs 4,350 will act as an immediate support level. MACD (moving average convergence divergence) is supporting the current strength whereas the momentum indicator RSI (relative strength index) is also positively poised.Expert: Mitesh Karwa, research analyst at Bonanza PortfolioState Bank of India: Buy | LTP: Rs 610 | Stop-Loss: Rs 580 | Target: Rs 657 | Return: 8 percentState Bank of India has seen breaking out of a Cup and Handle pattern on the weekly timeframe with a bullish candlestick and closing above the highs of the last six months with above-average volumes which indicates bullish strength.On the indicator front, the momentum oscillator RSI (relative strength index 14) is at around 67 on the daily time frame indicating strength by sustaining above 50. Ichimoku Cloud is also suggesting a bullish move as the price is trading above the conversion line, baseline and cloud on the daily timeframe.Observation of the above factors indicates that a bullish move in SBI is possible for a target of up to Rs 657 in 3-4 weeks. One can initiate a buy trade in the range of Rs 606-610 with a stop-loss of Rs 580 on a daily closing basis.Asahi India Glass: Buy | LTP: Rs 558.65 | Stop-Loss: Rs 496 | Target: Rs 650 | Return: 16 percentAsahi India Glass has seen giving a false breakdown on the weekly timeframe and closing with a bullish candlestick above the highs of the last six months and closing above all its important EMAs which indicates bullish strength.On the indicator front, the momentum oscillator RSI (14) is at around 70 showing strength by sustaining above 50.

One can initiate a buy trade in between the range of Rs 554-558, with a stop-loss of Rs 496 on a daily closing basis.Expert: Vidnyan Sawant, AVP - technical research at GEPL CapitalHDFC Asset Management Company: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,520 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,350 | Target: Rs 2,950 | Return: 17 percentHDFC AMC stock, after experiencing a correction since December 2019, has established a solid support base ranging from Rs 1,610 on the lower side to Rs 2,250 on the higher side.Recently, the stock broke out of the Double Bottom pattern, indicating the beginning of an upward trend.On the daily timeframe, HDFC AMC stock is currently trading above important moving averages, specifically the 50-day and 200-day exponential moving averages (EMA). This confirms the presence of an uptrend in the stock's price.Moreover, the relative strength index (RSI) on the weekly timeframe is showing positive momentum, as it has risen and sustained well above the 60 mark.Based on our analysis, we anticipate that the prices of HDFC AMC will continue to rise towards Rs 2,950 level. It is crucial to strictly maintain a stop-loss at Rs 2,350, based on the closing prices.Century Textiles and Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 971.75 | Stop-Loss: Rs 900 | Target: Rs 1,120 | Return: 15 percentCentury Textiles stock is currently demonstrating strong momentum as it is approaching record highs. In addition, a breakout of the bearish channel on the weekly timeframe in late June 2023 suggests a continuation of the upward trend.Furthermore, the RSI has shown a breakout, indicating increasing momentum in the stock's price. Given these compelling factors, it can be inferred that Century Textiles stock is displaying robust performance.Looking ahead, we anticipate the prices to climb towards Rs 1,120 level. It is recommended to set a stop-loss at Rs 900 based on closing prices to effectively manage potential downside risks.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

However, in a negative surprise, the company has sharply lowered its FY24 revenue growth guidance to 1.0-3.5% YoY CC from 4.0-7.0% YoY CC earlier. It has attributed the guidance cut to lower-than-expected volume and discretionary spends, delays in decision-making and push-outs in anticipated mega deals. EBIT margin declined 20bp to 20.8% (30bp miss), due to higher employee expenses vs. efficiency gains. Despite the steep revenue guidance cut, INFO has maintained its FY24 EBIT margin guidance at 20-22%.OutlookWe lower our FY24 EPS estimates by 4% to factor in the guidance cut, but we largely maintain our FY25 estimates.

"  July 22, 2023 / 07:00 AM IST  ","Reliance in Q1: A look at profits, capex, booming businesses, and challenges","Reliance Industries reported a 6 percent year-on-year drop in net profit and 4.7 percent fall in revenue for the quarter ended June 2023 owing to a muted performance in its oil-to-chemical business (O2C), even as the retail and telecom businesses continued their rapid growth. The key numbers failed to meet analyst expectations.Here are key highlights of the quarterly earnings:Revenue & Profits-        Consolidated net profit attributable to shareholders stood at Rs 16,011 crore in the June 2023 quarter, down 11 percent YoY.-        Consolidated total revenue in the June quarter declined to Rs 2.31 lakh crore, down 4.7 percent YoY.-        O2C earnings were lower due to a sharp fall in fuel cracks from exceptionally high levels in 1Q FY23.-        Higher subscriber base and customer engagement led revenue and profitability growth for digital services. Retail earnings reflect expanded footprint and improved profitability with operating leverage.-        Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) increased 5.1 percent YoY to Rs 41,982 crore.Expenses-        Overall expenses during April-June 2023 fell to Rs 1.90 lakh crore versus Rs 1.98 lakh crore.-        Depreciation increased by 31.7 percent YoY to Rs 11,775 crore due to expanded asset base across all the businesses.-        Finance costs increased by 46 percent YoY to Rs 5,837 crore ($ 711 million), primarily due to higher interest rates and loan balances.Capex rises-        Capital expenditure for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, was Rs 39,645 crore, up from Rs 31,442 crore YoY.-        The company’s expansion plan includes building four giga factories in Jamnagar, Gujarat.Jio Financial demerger on track-        The demerger of Jio Financial Services Ltd from RIL is on track with key approvals in place, said Mukesh D. Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director, RIL.Jio Platforms-        Jio Platforms, which houses Reliance’s telecom and digital businesses, saw 12.5 percent growth in profit and 11.3 percent in revenue.-        Operating revenue growth was driven by subscriber gains in connectivity business and scale-up of digital services.-        EBITDA grew 14.8 percent led by revenue increase with increased margins.-        Jio said it has deployed over 115,000 sites with 690,000 5G cells covering more than 90 percent census towns and is leading in terms of both network availability and customer experiences.Reliance Retail-        Reliance’s retail business reported a net profit growth of 18.8 percent and revenue growth of 20.5 percent.-        EBITDA margin from operations on net sales was at 7.9 percent, up 30 bps YoY driven by efficiencies, the company said.-        The business opened 555 new stores during the quarter. Now it has a total 18,446 stores.-        The quarter also recorded the highest ever footfalls at 249 million across formats.O2C: Challenging quarter-        O2C demand was impacted by destocking on recessionary fears and high interest rates, as well as slower than expected ramp-up in China markets.-        The company said YoY comparisons are skewed due to historic high fuel cracks in 1Q FY23, with dislocation in energy markets.-        EBITDA for 1Q FY24 reduced by 23.2 percent YoY to Rs 15,271 crore led by fall in transportation fuel cracks and lower downstream chemical margins.-        Revenues declined 17.7 percent and exports 28.2 percent YoYExploration business-        RIL’s oil and gas exploration business saw revenue rise 27.8 percent during the quarter on account of higher gas price realization and increase in KGD6 volumes with start-up of oil and condensate production from MJ fields.-        EBITDA increased to Rs 4,015 crore, up by 46.7 percent YoY.-        EBITDA margin was at 86.7 percent, up by 120 bps as compared to Q1FY23.Cash in hand-        RIL said cash on its books as of 30 June 2023 was Rs 1,92,064 crore, lower from Rs 1,88,200 crore at the end of the March quarter. This includes the impact of demerger of Jio Financial Services.Disclaimer: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

"  July 21, 2023 / 10:42 AM IST  ",The Underachievers: These 8 Nifty stocks are yet to join the bull run,"Despite today's selloff, Dalal Street has consistently surged to record highs in recent sessions, bringing smiles to investors who have been enjoying the benefits of a strong bull run. However, amidst this euphoria, there are still pockets of gloom.Only eight Nifty50 stocks are trading in the red on a year-to-date basis.These include two Adani Group companies, India’s largest lender, India’s leading steel maker, India’s second-biggest IT firm, a pharma major, the metals flagship of the Aditya Birla Group, and an agri inputs giant.Clearly corporate pedigree is no insurance against stock market pain.Follow our live blog for all the market actionAnalysts attribute this underperformance to a host of factors, ranging from a hit to profitability due to operational challenges to global headwinds and the most potent reason of them all – because the market so desires.“If we leave the Adani stocks aside, the remaining are facing company-specific issues like challenging operative environment, price pressures etc. For SBI, there’s no particular problem on the company side, but we must remember the stock had a good run over the previous 2-year period, so it can be viewed as a time correction,” Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Retail Research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, told Moneycontrol.“All in all, the fact that we have just eight underperformers itself shows the health and breadth of this bull run,” he added.The biggest laggards on the list are the Hindenburg-mauled Adani Group’s firms Adani Enterprises and Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd.While most Adani firms have rebounded from the lows triggered by the damning report of US-based short-seller Hindenburg Research, they are still some distance away from their 52-week highs.For example, Adani Enterprises is trading 70 percent below its 52-week high of Rs 4,189.55, while Adani Ports still needs to climb 35 percent to reach its 52-week peak of Rs 987.90.In the case of agri solutions company UPL, the share prices nosedived after its fourth quarter numbers were pummelled by a rapid decline in post-patent product prices as China’s post-Covid reopening led to an oversupply of agri chemicals.Most analysts anticipate the company’s operational performance to remain subdued at least in the first half of FY24.Global macro headwinds have claimed three more prominent victims – Hindalco, Tata Steel and Infosys.Metals and mining giant Hindalco, which soared to its 52-week high in January this year, has been trending downward since then, weighed by the muted performance of its US-based subsidiary Novelis, lacklustre global demand environment as well as shutdown of a copper plant for maintenance.Tata Steel too suffered from weak demand across geographies and elevated input costs (mainly coking coal). However, robust steel demand in India and declining trend in raw material prices have kept the Street largely optimistic about the company’s prospects.No such luck for Infosys, which is bearing the brunt of global tightening of IT budgets due to the slowdown in the EU and US – the bread-and-butter markets for India’s software service players.A string of high-profile exits over the past few months has further stoked fears over the company’s leadership attrition and near-term roadmap.Infosys has the most ‘sell’ ratings in this list as well as the steepest decline in the number of ‘buy’ calls compared to January 2023.Infosys on July 20 posted an 11 percent increase in its net profit to Rs 5,945 crore, missing market expectations.However, what came as a shocker was its revenue growth guidance for the current fiscal being slashed to 1-3.5 percent from 4-7 percent, triggering a rout in the company’s American Depository Receipts (ADRs) as well as domestic shares.So severe has been the selling in Infosys this morning that the stock almost single-handedly prevented the Nifty from scaling the historic 20,000-mark which market participants were eagerly looking forward to.Also Read: Infosys nosedives 10% on sharp guidance cut; fuels brokerage downgradesPharma company Cipla has the second highest number of ‘sell’ ratings, with the Street fretting over delays in potential launches in the key market of North America, regulatory risks and limited upside from current levels.Cipla shares went into a tailspin in February after the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) issued 8 observations for its Pithampur manufacturing facility. The company had said it would address the matter ‘within stipulated time.’SBI is a bit of an anomaly in this list as the Street view is largely positive for the banking behemoth, despite the ‘government discount’ most PSU stocks suffer from.Notably, the entire banking sector is thriving at this time, and public sector lenders collectively posted a record net profit of Rs 1.05 lakh crore in FY23, with SBI and others reporting their highest-ever earnings amid a steady decline in bad assets and healthy loan demand.Of course, SBI is only marginally lower at this point and may well find itself out of this list by the time it announces its Q1 FY24 results amid expectations of another set of strong numbers.Which means more wind beneath the wings of the current rally. And not to forget, wider smiles.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.
