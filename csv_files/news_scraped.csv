"  May 02, 2023 / 07:50 AM IST  ",How complete gets Godrej after buying out Raymond's? Whiff of scepticism in the air,"Godrej Consumer's acquisition of Raymond's consumer care business will make the seller debt-free, but could the acquirer experience buyer's remorse?The Street is sceptical about how soon Godrej Consumer Products Limited (GCPL) can increase market penetration and drive growth in Raymond’s deodorants and sexual wellness products. This explains the 4.5 percent knock in Godrej Consumer Products’ share price on April 28, said analysts.“Brand spends are always high. Any cost synergies of acquiring Raymond Consumer Care’s portfolio will be spent on increasing Park Avenue and Kamasutra’s brand voice,” said Kaustubh Pawaskar of Sharekhan.On April 27, GCPL announced the acquisition of Raymond's consumer care business in an all-cash deal for Rs 2,825 crore. The FMCG business, along with the Park Avenue (FMCG category), KS, KamaSutra, and Premium trademarks will be acquired by May 10, through a slump sale.Tough categoryThough Godrej Consumer expects the acquisition to be EPS (earnings per share) neutral by FY24-25, Pawaskar believes it might take longer given the intense competition. In India, Fogg, Axe, Nivea, Engage, Park Avenue, and Wildstone are some of the big brands in the deodorant segment. Axe belongs to Hindustan Unilever and Engage to ITC, which have the financial muscle to run high-decibel campaigns.The market size for deodorants is Rs 5,000 crore, said the GCPL management in an analyst call, adding that the category is underpenetrated (~20 percent in urban markets). This is because in India, deodorants are often viewed as a luxury item rather than a necessity.Also Read: We didn't overpay for Raymond's FMCG business: GCPL vows to level off marginsBut not everyone shares that view. “Deodorants are now becoming more and more of a commoditised category. Fogg dominates the non-gas category. High contribution of modern trade means perpetual 2+1 offers running as EDLP pricing,” replied Nishchay Bahl on a Twitter thread. EDLP in marketing jargon expands to ‘Every day, Low pricing.’Interestingly, Bahl is the Chief Business Officer at Good Glamm Group, which was earlier in talks to acquire Raymond’s consumer care business.Aggressive pricing is not the only factor. The average MRP of a deodorant can is around Rs 200-220, whereas the NSP (net selling price), which is adjusted for discounts, is Rs 120-130, implying that trade channels have a strong say in what gets pushed.For Raymond Consumer, with an annual turnover of Rs 622 crore in FY22-23, about 60 percent of sales came from deodorants. Godrej expects this business to grow by ~10 percent-plus year-on-year.That optimism aside, some analysts even questioned the rationale for multiple deodorant brands. “Why the need for the Park Avenue brand when GCPL’s own Cinthol brand is rather under-utilised at present,” asks JM Financial’s Richard Liu and Mehul Desai. Cinthol itself has pretty strong brand-equity, they believe.Plus, they also see a risk in Godrej Consumer sharing the Park Avenue FMCG trademark with Raymond’s apparel trademark. “This could have its own repercussions in the event of any adverse development in the other entity.”Distribution playEven the sexual wellness category has aggressive competitors like Mankind and Reckitt Benckiser. Still, the total addressable market for commercial condoms, at Rs 1,200 crore, has a huge runway, believe analysts. With Kamasutra among the top three condom brands in the country, GCPL’s focus will be on premiumisation.Also Read: Godrej Consumer’s price tag for Raymond’s FMCG brands leaves little room for errorThat said, both condoms and deodorants have single-digit operating margins. Godrej Consumer, on the other hand, has an 18-20 percent operating margin. The management’s aim is to scale up the margins of the former to the levels of the latter by FY24-25, thus making the deal EPS neutral.GCPL plans to leverage its general trade and alternative channels to expand distribution. “Our direct distribution is 4X that of Raymond Consumer Care. So, the products will reach farther and wider,” said Managing Director and CEO Sudhir Sitapati after the acquisition.How soon the scale-up plays out remains a key monitorable. With challenges ahead, the Street views the acquisition as expensive at a 3.75X EV/sales ratio.“Coupled with higher interest costs and initial investments required to integrate RCCL’s business, overall EPS would see a dilution of 4 percent/2 percent for FY24E / FY25E,” feels Nuvama Institutional Equities. Meanwhile, Motilal Oswal Securities has cut GCPL's EPS by 3 percent for FY24, and sees no material change for FY25.The ‘buy’ rating on the stock remains intact, largely on the back of its air freshener and home insecticides business. Godrej Consumer's Indonesia business is also expected to turn around in FY23-24.As per Trendlyne, the consensus target on the stock is Rs 1,020, which represents an upside of 12 percent from the last traded price.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

The prices of pet coke and coal jumped 18 percent on-year. In addition, raw material costs went up 9 percent year-on-year, primarily due to an increase in the cost of materials such as fly ash, slag, and gypsum. UltraTech Cement, however, delivered a robust 14 percent on-year or 23 percent on-quarter volume surge in Q4FY23.""Factoring in better-than-expected volume growth, we are revising up FY25 EBITDA by 2 percent; maintain the ‘hold’ rating with a revised target price of Rs 7,339 (Rs 7,122 earlier) based on 14.5x EV/EBITDA,"" said Nuvama Research in a note to investors.The demand for cement has continued to remain stable in April 2023, following a robust performance in the fourth quarter of FY23. UltraTech is aiming to outpace industry growth by 4-5 percentage points in the upcoming fiscal year FY24. Cement prices will remain steady in April 2023, the company said.In Q4FY23, UltraTech Cement commissioned a 5.6 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) capacity, with an additional capacity of approximately 2.1 mtpa expected to be added in Q1FY24. This will bring the company's total capacity to 131mtpa. The second phase of expansion, which involves adding 22.6mtpa, is progressing well and expected to be completed by June 2025, bringing the total capacity to 154mtpa. The company aims to double its ready-mix concrete (RMC) plants from 231. It operates seven bulk cement terminals, and with the phase 2 expansion, two more terminals are expected to be commissioned.Antique's analysis indicates that UltraTech experienced a notable increase in market share during the fourth quarter, and this trend is expected to persist in the medium-term due to the company's well-timed plans to expand its capacity.UltraTech is expected to maintain its position as a leader in the industry in terms of profitability, with a diversified market mix, premium brand positioning, and improving cost efficiencies being key drivers of its success.""We largely retain our FY24/FY25 estimates and reiterate our 'buy' rating on the stock, given its: (a) leadership position in the industry with a market share of 26 percent in FY23, (b) robust expansion plans without leveraging the balance sheet, and (c) structural cost improvement. We value UltraTech at 15.5x FY25 EV/EBITDA to arrive at our revised target price of Rs8,600 (implying EV/t of $200),"" said Motilal Oswal in its latest report.According to Systematix Institutional Equities, margin expansion for UltraTech would be driven by increased volumes, improved cost efficiency, and operating leverage. Additionally, a reduction in costs and stronger volumes, along with a robust balance sheet, would be the key drivers of near-term margin expansion for the company.Despite investing in annual capex of Rs 60-70 billion, UltraTech is expected to have net cash in its balance sheet, providing it with ample room to pursue expansion while also moderating its operating costs.Meanwhile, the brokerage firm CLSA has downgraded UltraTech Cement to underperform from Outperform and kept its target price at Rs 7900 a share from its current market price.",UltraTech Cement Ltd.
