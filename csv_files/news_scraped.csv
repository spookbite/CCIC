Due to sharp rise in RM cost/te by +55% y/y resulted in total cost/te increase of +6% y/y, despite power cost/te correcting by -11% y/y in Q4FY23. Therefore, EBITDA came 7% below YSECe at Rs955/te (-8% y/y). Reported PAT came at Rs6bn (v/s YSECe Rs3bn) on account of adjustment for associate “DBRL” of Rs5.29bn profit and exceptional item of Rs1.44bn as loss in Q4FY23. Management deferred the 2.5MTPA GU expansion in Bihar due to JP Associates inorganic opportunity, changed the original capacity target to 46.6MTPA by FY24E (excl. 9.4MTPA of JP Associates). As a result, our revenue/ EBITDA/PAT estimate moderated by 3/5/2% respectively for FY25E. With long term positive demand outlook and incremental capacities, we believe DALBHARA to clock a volume growth of +11/7% y/y for FY24/25E. Company signed a definitive agreement for acquiring the JP Associate’s cement assets (9.4MTPAcement & 6.7MTPA clinker) at an EV of Rs56.7bn (additional Rs8bn for refurbishment). Furthermore, with JPAssociates assets, DALBHARA will make breakthroughs in the central market fulfilling its PAN India aspiration. We believe the sustenance of cement prices & demand especially in east/south market will be vital for DALBHARA to offset the cost pressures, while huge capacity addition in the East will keep prices under check. We continue to like DALBHARA: 1) Stronghold in East/South key markets, 2) Ventured in west and seeking entry in central India, 3) Strong Infra push in the East/South by govt., 4) Incremental volumes from new added capacities, 5) Cost optimization measures (plans to reach 324MW of green power capacity) set to improve the efficiency.OutlookWe maintain our BUY rating with a TP of Rs2,582 valuing the stock at 15x EV/EBITDA on the FY25E.For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

"  April 27, 2023 / 05:40 PM IST  ",Why life insurance stocks are seeing renewed interest amid growth worries,"On February 1, listed life insurers saw their valuations erode by more than 10 percent as the Union Budget brought in tax rules that would shave off a big part of their business growth. Investors believed that the stellar growth trajectory of the industry was now a thing of the past and so valuations should come down.Since April, though, life insurance shares have gained, in a sign that the earlier expectations of growth deceleration were overdone. Shares of the largest life insurer, Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), have risen nearly 1 percent. ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company Ltd's stock has gained nearly 2 percent, while Max Financial Services Ltd has gained roughly 1 percent. HDFC Life Insurance Company Ltd and SBI Life Insurance Company Ltd have gained more than 3 percent.So, what has changed for investors to be nibbling on life insurance stocks now? The answer: another change in tax rules and a returning optimism on growth.Tax lost is tax gainedIn the budget, the government had proposed that the proceeds of insurance policies with premiums in excess of Rs 5 lakh would be taxed in the hands of the holder. Further, the centre made the new tax regime, which removes almost all exemptions, as the default tax regime from 2023-24 onwards. To be sure, shifting to the new tax regime remains optional, but the government’s intent cannot be ignored.These rules, which took effect on April 1, were seen as hurting business growth for the life insurance companies. After all, India’s life insurers relied on deep-pocketed clients who invested lumpy amounts to avail of tax exemptions.But on April 1, another tax rule change took effect. The government removed the indexation benefit on debt mutual funds by bringing all of them under the marginal tax rate. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities believe that some of the investment into these debt funds could now reflow into insurance policies with a smaller premium size.“Notably, income from non-linked insurance policies below Rs 0.5 million of the annual premium remain(s) tax-free; hence, we believe that some incremental flows from debt mutual funds may be directed to such policies. This will help offset the impact of the slowdown in high ticket (over Rs 0.5 million) policies,” they wrote in the April 21 note.Further, there are mitigating tactics that can help insurers bypass the tax exemption rule. “The Rs 500k annual premium limit for tax breaks on traditional (par/non-par) products is seen as relevant to a small section of potential demand, given mitigations are possible (for example, splitting the premium between spouses in the same family),” wrote Santanu Chakrabarti, an analyst at BNP Paribas India in a note.A stronger MarchListed life insurers lived up to the expectations of investors in the January-March quarter. SBI Life reported 11 percent growth in total annualised premium equivalent and profitability metrics, such as value of the new business. And its margins beat Street expectations. HDFC Life, too, reported healthy growth metrics but the acquisition of Exide Life resulted in an increase in expense ratios.That said, analysts believe that repeating growth in FY24 won’t be an easy task for life insurers.The outsized business growth in the March quarter was expected as life insurers made last-ditch efforts to sell as many large-sized policies as possible before the tax changes took effect. The 59 percent surge in the ticket size of policies for the month of March shows this last-minute dash. For HDFC Life, this rush contributed to 35 percent of premiums in March.Even so, listed life insurers exceeded market expectations of business growth for the quarter. Analysts at Morgan Stanley pointed out that the 38 percent year-on-year growth in retail weighted received premium (RWRP) for the industry and 56 percent for private life insurers were much stronger than expectations. Data from the industry regulator showed that private sector life insurers reported 53 percent business growth for March, taking the overall growth for FY23 to 24 percent, on an annualised premium equivalent basis.Further, management guidance on growth in FY24 has been optimistic amid emerging concerns over the tax rule impact. Chief executives of life insurers have asserted that tax exemptions are no longer the driving factor for life insurance policies.All this is contributing to the interest among investors in life insurance stocks.Future imperfectThe growth in FY23 may have exceeded expectations but the outlook for FY24 is still cloudy. This explains why the gains in life insurance stocks have so far been modest. Further, investors are awaiting the fourth-quarter earnings of insurers such as SBI Life, LIC and HDFC Life in the coming weeks. The results of ICICI Prulife, which released its Q4 earnings on April 20, show that investors’ assumptions on profitability and growth have been met.Meanwhile, the impact of the tax rule changes on life insurers will be fully visible only in the second half of FY24. Insurers are already putting in place mitigating measures through changes in pricing and the product mix. How much they will be able to reverse the impact on growth will be keenly monitored.Chakrabarti of BNP Paribas pointed out that current valuations reflect the concerns surrounding growth. “We continue to believe that current market prices reflect the fear of both a near-term revenue decline as well as a reduction in TAM (total addressable market),” he said.Most analysts expect insurance stocks to be under pressure in FY24 given the growth concerns. At the same time, valuations look appealing for some after the sharp post-budget erosion. Re-rating triggers, though, are slim and should be visible two quarters down.",HDFC Life Insurance Company Ltd.

The company will announce its Q4 FY23 results on April 27 during market hours.According to a poll of brokerages, HUL’s standalone Q4 revenue is seen at Rs 15,277 crore and net profit at Rs 2,584 crore. Estimates suggest price-hike led revenue growth will be about 9 percent and volume growth will be close to 5 percent. Last quarter, too, volume growth was 5 percent.“We expect continued strength in home care revenue growth on the back of price hikes in laundry. There will be some improvement in beauty and personal care segment, as the spillover in winter portfolio gets offset by price cuts in skin cleansing,” as per Kotak Institutional Equities.Home care segment’s sales is seen rising 22 percent YoY and personal care products by 10 percent, on the back of festivities and increased outdoor activities.On the margin front, EBITDA margin is expected to decline marginally on a year-on-year basis due to higher advertisement spends. EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.In Q3, too, the company had not passed on the full impact of cool off in palm oil prices and had upped ad spends instead. BNP Paribas expects A&P spends to be 8.5 percent of Q4 sales.The key factors to watch will be how rural markets are faring vis-à-vis urban areas. HUL derives 40 percent of its sales from rural India, where consumers have been downtrading to cheaper alternatives thus impacting volume growth.The Street is also waiting to hear from CEO designate Rohit Jawa, who takes over Sanjiv Mehta in June. This will be Mehta’s last earnings concall with HUL.Other key factors to watch: Outlook on nutrition business, discretionary consumption and out-of-home demand.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Analysts, however, remained cautious and maintained the 'sell' rating while reducing the target price for the stock. The stock was trading at Rs 3546 on the BSE, up 2.9 percent from its previous close.The engineering services company reported a 22 percent increase in net profit, reaching Rs 1,174.1 crore by the end of FY23. In Q4 of FY23, LTTS recorded a net profit of about Rs310.9 crore, posting an 18 percent rise over the same period last year. The company experienced a 19.4 percent on-year growth in revenue from operations at Rs 2,096.2 crore, primarily driven by the transportation, plant engineering, and industrial products verticals.Sequentially, revenue from North America, which contributes 60.2 percent to the company's total revenue, declined 1.4 percent. In full FY23, LTTS achieved $990 million in CC revenue.In FY2023, LTTS secured 18 large deals worth $10 million or more, which is lower than the 20 large deals it had bagged a year before. The management has, however, indicated that the total contract value (TCV) of the deals, including those below $10 million, is slightly higher than the levels achieved in FY2022.""We believe this trend indicates client view of macro uncertainty. Pressure in relatively smaller sub-segments of semi-conductor and hyperscaler projects further reflect dynamic macro pressures,"" said Dolat Analysis & Research in its report. The brokerage house maintained its 'sell' rating and kept the target price at Rs 3,240 a share.Despite some weakness in the semiconductor and hyperscaler sectors, the overall commentary from the management remains strong, with great traction across other sectors. Based on the broad-based deal pipeline and growth momentum, the management has guided the FY24 revenue growth to be 10 percent or more in organic CC terms, implying a 2.8 percent compounded quarterly growth rate (CQGR). Additionally, they expect a 20 percent or more revenue growth, including acquisition.According to a Kotak report, L&T Tech had a good quarter, and their organic growth guidance is in line with expectations. However, the report notes that risks exist due to the discretionary nature of the ERD business and a slowdown in developed markets. While the report broadly maintains EPS estimates and a target multiple of 21X FY2025 EPS, leading to an FV of Rs 3,000, it considers the stock to be expensive and maintains its 'sell' rating on the stock.""Given the margin-dilutive and working-capital-intensive nature of SWC's business, it is expected that the FY2024 EBIT margin will decline to approximately 17 percent, down from 18.5 percent in FY2023. Additionally, receivables days are anticipated to increase to 115-125 days, as compared to 95 days in FY2023. It should be noted that the ERD business is discretionary in nature, which may not be the best attribute during a deteriorating environment,"" the Kotak report said.Dolat Analysis & Research believes that their existing USD revenue estimates already reflect the Q4 results and the management guidance for FY24. As a result, they will keep their growth estimates for FY24/FY25 unchanged. The integration of SWC was factored into their previous estimates, but they will moderately increase their margin estimates by 57bps/34bps for FY24/FY25 to reflect the guidance for a 17 percent margin for FY24. Overall, they have raised their earnings estimates by 3.3 percent/1.8 percent, respectively for FY24/FY25, based on the reported results.Motilal Oswal anticipates that the increased spending on engineering, research, and development (ER&D) due to digitisation will benefit LTTS, as the company has strong capabilities, a multi-vertical presence, and a solid wallet share. The company is expected to achieve robust revenue growth in the upcoming years.Motilal also expects industry spends to improve compared to the preceding five years, which should further benefit LTTS given its strong position and capabilities in the engineering and R&D space. The brokerage firm has maintained the 'buy' rating and kept the target price at Rs 4,040 a share.According to the brokerage house, the valuations of LTTS have significantly decreased over the last year, and they are now at 22x FY25 EPS. This is seen as an attractive valuation because the outlook for the ER&D services industry is better than the broader IT services universe.",L&T Technology Services Ltd.

While margins were in line with our estimate, the EBITDA miss was due to a lower-than-expected average ASP. In the recent past, the stock has underperformed on concerns of whether MSIL would be able to recover lost share in UVs, given heightened competition. In our view, MSIL seems to be on the right path of recovering back its lost share: it has launched three new models in the SUV segment (Grand Vitara, Jimny and Fronx) in a span of six months. On the back of these new launches, MSIL’s order backlog has now increased to 420k units. Given this and further new launches expected in FY24, MSIL expects to sharply improve its market share to 25% in FY24 in the SUV segment, from 11% in FY23 (already improved to 18% in Q4). Also, MSIL remains a major beneficiary of the recent BS6-phase2 norms as it will drive shift in demand further towards petrol variants.

"  April 27, 2023 / 05:40 PM IST  ",Why life insurance stocks are seeing renewed interest amid growth worries,"On February 1, listed life insurers saw their valuations erode by more than 10 percent as the Union Budget brought in tax rules that would shave off a big part of their business growth. Investors believed that the stellar growth trajectory of the industry was now a thing of the past and so valuations should come down.Since April, though, life insurance shares have gained, in a sign that the earlier expectations of growth deceleration were overdone. Shares of the largest life insurer, Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), have risen nearly 1 percent. ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company Ltd's stock has gained nearly 2 percent, while Max Financial Services Ltd has gained roughly 1 percent. HDFC Life Insurance Company Ltd and SBI Life Insurance Company Ltd have gained more than 3 percent.So, what has changed for investors to be nibbling on life insurance stocks now? The answer: another change in tax rules and a returning optimism on growth.Tax lost is tax gainedIn the budget, the government had proposed that the proceeds of insurance policies with premiums in excess of Rs 5 lakh would be taxed in the hands of the holder. Further, the centre made the new tax regime, which removes almost all exemptions, as the default tax regime from 2023-24 onwards. To be sure, shifting to the new tax regime remains optional, but the government’s intent cannot be ignored.These rules, which took effect on April 1, were seen as hurting business growth for the life insurance companies. After all, India’s life insurers relied on deep-pocketed clients who invested lumpy amounts to avail of tax exemptions.But on April 1, another tax rule change took effect. The government removed the indexation benefit on debt mutual funds by bringing all of them under the marginal tax rate. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities believe that some of the investment into these debt funds could now reflow into insurance policies with a smaller premium size.“Notably, income from non-linked insurance policies below Rs 0.5 million of the annual premium remain(s) tax-free; hence, we believe that some incremental flows from debt mutual funds may be directed to such policies. This will help offset the impact of the slowdown in high ticket (over Rs 0.5 million) policies,” they wrote in the April 21 note.Further, there are mitigating tactics that can help insurers bypass the tax exemption rule. “The Rs 500k annual premium limit for tax breaks on traditional (par/non-par) products is seen as relevant to a small section of potential demand, given mitigations are possible (for example, splitting the premium between spouses in the same family),” wrote Santanu Chakrabarti, an analyst at BNP Paribas India in a note.A stronger MarchListed life insurers lived up to the expectations of investors in the January-March quarter. SBI Life reported 11 percent growth in total annualised premium equivalent and profitability metrics, such as value of the new business. And its margins beat Street expectations. HDFC Life, too, reported healthy growth metrics but the acquisition of Exide Life resulted in an increase in expense ratios.That said, analysts believe that repeating growth in FY24 won’t be an easy task for life insurers.The outsized business growth in the March quarter was expected as life insurers made last-ditch efforts to sell as many large-sized policies as possible before the tax changes took effect. The 59 percent surge in the ticket size of policies for the month of March shows this last-minute dash. For HDFC Life, this rush contributed to 35 percent of premiums in March.Even so, listed life insurers exceeded market expectations of business growth for the quarter. Analysts at Morgan Stanley pointed out that the 38 percent year-on-year growth in retail weighted received premium (RWRP) for the industry and 56 percent for private life insurers were much stronger than expectations. Data from the industry regulator showed that private sector life insurers reported 53 percent business growth for March, taking the overall growth for FY23 to 24 percent, on an annualised premium equivalent basis.Further, management guidance on growth in FY24 has been optimistic amid emerging concerns over the tax rule impact. Chief executives of life insurers have asserted that tax exemptions are no longer the driving factor for life insurance policies.All this is contributing to the interest among investors in life insurance stocks.Future imperfectThe growth in FY23 may have exceeded expectations but the outlook for FY24 is still cloudy. This explains why the gains in life insurance stocks have so far been modest. Further, investors are awaiting the fourth-quarter earnings of insurers such as SBI Life, LIC and HDFC Life in the coming weeks. The results of ICICI Prulife, which released its Q4 earnings on April 20, show that investors’ assumptions on profitability and growth have been met.Meanwhile, the impact of the tax rule changes on life insurers will be fully visible only in the second half of FY24. Insurers are already putting in place mitigating measures through changes in pricing and the product mix. How much they will be able to reverse the impact on growth will be keenly monitored.Chakrabarti of BNP Paribas pointed out that current valuations reflect the concerns surrounding growth. “We continue to believe that current market prices reflect the fear of both a near-term revenue decline as well as a reduction in TAM (total addressable market),” he said.Most analysts expect insurance stocks to be under pressure in FY24 given the growth concerns. At the same time, valuations look appealing for some after the sharp post-budget erosion. Re-rating triggers, though, are slim and should be visible two quarters down.",SBI Life Insurance Company Ltd.
