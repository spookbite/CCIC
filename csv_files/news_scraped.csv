"  January 13, 2023 / 06:55 PM IST  ",D-Mart Q3 Preview | Consolidated net profit expected to rise 17% YoY,"The share price of Avenue Supermarts, operator of retail chain D-Mart, closed 1.45 percent lower on January 13, a day ahead of its Q3 results announcement. The Street is expecting a consolidated net profit of Rs 646.5 crore, indicating a 17 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth but a 5.5 percent drop sequentially.“Q3 started on a steady note with retail companies witnessing strong demand offtake during the festive season (Navratri-Diwali). However, demand momentum started waning off during November and December,” according to ICICI Securities.Consolidated revenue from operations is expected to come in at Rs 11,504 crore, growing 25 percent YoY and 8.1 percent sequentially. EBITDA (Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) is seen at Rs 1,010 crore, up 16.6 percent YoY and 13.4 percent QoQ.In its Q3 business update, the company said it added four stores in the October-December quarter taking the total count to 306. ""Estimates stood at 12,"" said analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services. In Q1, the company had added 10 stores, followed by eight in Q2.The hypermarket chain operator reported standalone revenue from operations at Rs 11,304.58 crore for the quarter ended December FY23, increasing 25 percent from Rs 9,065 crore in the same period last year. Both store additions and revenue growth were lower than Street estimates.A key factor to watch in the results announcement will be gross and operating margin numbers. ICICI Securities expects EBITDA margins to contract by 60 basis points YoY to 8.8 percent. This will largely be on the back of seasonal weakness, said analysts.During the Q2 results announcement, the management highlighted that the FMCG and staples segment of the business had performed better than the general merchandise and apparel segments. The inflationary stress is more acute at lower price points in the discretionary non-FMCG category, the company had said.Analysts and investors will be keenly monitoring if there’s any improvement in the revenue share of general merchandise and apparel segments, which are the higher margin businesses.",Avenue Supermarts Ltd.

IT Services grew by 2.2% in CC terms with a robust new deal TCV of USD2.3b (flat QoQ/+10% YoY). The company maintained its FY23 USD revenue growth guidance of 13.5-14.0% in CC. Further, it delivered a strong beat in EBIT margin at 19.6% (+165bp QoQ, 110bp above our estimate), led by HCL Software, which was up 12.3pp. Services margin was largely flat QoQ (in line). HCLT narrowed its EBIT margin guidance to lower side at 18-18.5% from 18-19%. - Despite seasonality and a tough demand environment, HCLT maintained its growth momentum in both IT Services and ER&D verticals. HCL Software delivered strong growth, ahead of expectations on seasonality. The deal wins remained strong (book to bill of 0.7x). While there is visible weakness in macro, especially in Europe, increased vendor consolidation deals, a strong pipeline of cost-take out deals, and favorable pricing should help HCLT tackle any softness in discretionary spending and weak macro. Strong revenue growth guidance of 16-16.5% YoY in CC terms for the services should address investor concerns on the company’s growth. HCLT’s margin improvement over 2QFY23 and 3QFY23 despite wage hikes has been reassuring, and the company should continue to improve margins in FY24 as well. We expect HCLT to deliver FY23 margin near the mid-point of its guidance, and further improve to 18.7% in FY24. The strong growth guidance and margin performance in an environment, where demand for IT services is expected to be incrementally weaker, should boost investor confidence on HCLT’s business and lower the valuation gap with larger Tier-1 peers. We continue to see HCLT’s defensive business as positive in a demand-constrained environment. On a combined basis, HCLT is expected to deliver USD revenue growth of 11% and a corresponding PAT CAGR of 13.2% over FY22-25E. HCLT is currently trading at an inexpensive 15x FY24E EPS.OutlookWe have largely maintained our estimates.

Revenue grew by 5% CC QoQ because of strong performance in the software business (30.5% CC QoQ), while the services business (2.2% CC) delivered broadly in-line performance.

"  January 14, 2023 / 09:24 AM IST  ",Paytm down 75% from IPO price. Is this a good entry point for new investors?,"Shares of Paytm (One97 Communications) tanked over 6 per cent on January 12 on a part-stake sale by Alibaba Group. As of September 2022, Alibaba.com held 6.26 percent of the payments company and in a block deal it sold a 3 percent stake.The Paytm stock is down 75% from its Initial Public Offering (IPO) price. Does this make a good entry point for new investors?Well, one way is to say that there is still no clarity on how this business model will evolve because the company does not have any significant competitive advantage with respect to cross-selling opportunities that hold the key to ramping up the business in a big way in the long haul.The problem here, as I argued in one of my previous podcasts, is that the information aggregator platform that is now being built with information sharing from all the big banking and financial players will be a public good soon. And so, the data in itself may not be as big a proprietary edge as it was thought of, as far as credit is concerned.But when you evaluate the stock, the other way to look at the stock is to be in the moment, not think too long term, take one step at a time and see where the business heads with limited visibility into the future.Just think about the odds of Paytm going down versus going up relative to the rest of the market over the next few quarters. Suddenly, the picture may start to look a little better.Institutional support Purely from a technical perspective, on the demand-supply side, I think most of the IPO-related selling is now over. Of course, Alibaba is still a large investor and the sale on January 12 raises fresh concerns about how much more it may sell.But the flip side is that of late some institutional interest seems to be emerging in the stock. So that lends some support, and unless something goes wrong fundamentally, you may not see a huge price disruption.Also Read: How do Nykaa's profitability goals look in light of increasing competition?Now, let’s look at the prognosis fundamentally.Well, on January 9, Paytm reported that it distributed 3.7 million loans worth Rs 3,665 crore in December, up 330 percent on-year. For the December quarter, its total disbursements jumped 357 percent to Rs 9,958 crore.Monthly transacting users jumped 32 percent to 85 million in December from 65 million a year ago. Gross merchandise value processed through the platform increased 38 percent year-on-year in December to Rs 3.64 lakh crore.Paytm also added one million payment devices during October-December and the number of merchants paying a subscription fee for payment devices touched 5.8 million as of December 2022.The company's consumer engagement was at its highest on Paytm Super App with average monthly transacting users at 85 million for the quarter ended December 2022, up 32 percent on a yearly basis.Merchant network In essence, Paytm continues to add merchant network apart from customers to its platform. Plus over the past two years, Paytm’s net take-rate has improved from nothing to 13 basis points led by lower processing costs and a higher share of revenue from its Soundbox, which is a device that gets you audio or voice confirmation of payment in your preferred language.The share of subscription revenue in the total payment revenue is now at 14 percent of gross payment revenue and 38 percent of net payment revenue, according to analysts from CLSA.This is great, especially because Unified Payments Interface (UPI) payments do not earn the company any money but, now that Paytm has shown the way, others like PhonePe could take away any further gains. Also Read: How Zomato plans to achieve a balance in profitability and growth?The other part of Paytm’s business, i.e, the lending business is also growing at a very good pace. Paytm’s plan is to start selling credit cards to all its customers who avail of Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) kind of loans, which can become a significant revenue driver.Overall, if Paytm is able to grow its subscription revenues from merchant devises, and also expand its loan book at the pace at which it is growing currently, while maintaining credit quality, it is only a matter of time that it will be able to cover its costs and emerge profitable.EBITDA break-even Of course, the ability of the company to grow its loan book without any asset quality issues is still to be tested, because this business is still at a nascent stage. But then, asset-quality issues will take time to unravel if at all those happen.But in the meantime, the management has committed to making the company Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) break-even by the second quarter of FY24, and analysts believe this can be achieved.For instance, JP Morgan expects a cash burn of $33 million over the next three quarters until break-even is achieved in the second quarter. One very important thing to watch out for will be the company’s ability to cut fixed costs especially as the bulk of its business, which is payments, has high fixed costs with low-revenue contribution. The company’s ability to cut this will be crucial to enhancing its core profitability.In the next few quarters, there is a good chance that the management will achieve what it says it is set out to do.Leap of faith All said and done, Paytm will require a leap of faith in the management’s ability to grow and cut costs effectively to run a tight ship.Of course, the big world-changing vision that was projected earlier has shrunk substantially but then the market price has corrected significantly too. Today, Paytm trades at a valuation it saw more than five years ago, in 2016. Also Read: Morgan Stanley, Ghisallo Master Fund buy Paytm shares worth Rs 560.2 croreAnd nearly a third of its market cap is covered by the cash in its book which stood at $1.1 billion as of September 2022 apart from the $127 million outlay in cash for a buy-back. Plus, the fact that the Paytm board approved a buyback at a price of Rs 810 per share also provides some pyschological comfort.Paytm has come to a level where it is looking interesting, but investing in the company still comes with a lot of ifs and buts. It really depends on what kind of temperament you have as an investor and about how much risk you can stomach.",One 97 Communications Ltd.

"  January 13, 2023 / 10:54 AM IST  ",Buy Prestige Estates Projects; target of Rs 675: Motilal Oswal,"Motilal Oswal's research report on Prestige Estates ProjectsPEPL stock has not seen any major re-rating despite continued strong performance in its residential business. In our opinion, this is likely due to concerns over leverage given a heavy capex cycle ahead of us. We expect CY23 to be a defining year for PEPL as it looks to grow its pre-sales on a strong base, provide growth visibility, and allay concerns of rise in leverage beyond a comfortable level. PEPL’s 25msf launch pipeline (over 12 months) and strong business development plans will provide clarity on further scale-up in residential business and robust cash flow generation. While PEPL continues its aggressive stance on commercial strategy, a large part of its capex is likely to be funded from internal accruals, capping the net debt at not more than 0.5- 0.6x of equity.OutlookWe reiterate our BUY rating with a TP of INR675 and rate it as our top pick in real estate sector for CY23.For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

"  January 13, 2023 / 10:50 AM IST  ",Buy TCS; target of Rs 3810: Motilal Oswal,"Motilal Oswal's research report on TCSTCS reported revenue of USD7.08b in 3QFY23, up 2.2% QoQ in constant currency (CC) terms, 60bp above our estimates despite seasonal weakness. The company reported deal wins of USD7.8b (down 3.7% QoQ/up 2.6% YoY, book-to-bill ratio at 1.1x), in line with our expectations. EBIT improved 50bp QoQ to 24.5%, in line with our estimates, aided by favorable FX (+70bp), improved utilization and lower sub-con costs (+30bp), partly offset (-50bp) by third-party expenses and travel normalization. LTM attrition moderated by 20bp to 21.3%, while attrition declined 6% QoQ on the quarterly annualized basis. TCS expects the supply situation to further ease, resulting in a continued downward trajectory in attrition ahead. Overall, management commentary on demand environment indicate caution in the near term despite consistent growth in the deal pipeline, as North America and continental Europe see a near-term deal conversion slowdown on account of macroeconomic challenges. But, TCS reiterated its aspiration of double-digit growth in the medium to long term. We continue to see growth constrains over the next two quarters, although TCS should be relatively insulated on account of its strong deal backlog (LTM TCV at USD35.4b, 1.3x book to bill). While we expect demand to start normalizing by Q2FY24, reduced visibility remains a key risk on FY24 growth. We factor in a USD revenue CAGR of 10% over FY22-25E.OutlookWe have largely maintained our FY23/FY24/FY25 EPS estimates. Over FY22- 25E, we expect a USD revenue CAGR of ~10% and an INR EPS CAGR of ~15%. Our TP of INR3,810 implies 28x FY24E EPS, with a 15% upside potential.

"  January 13, 2023 / 10:54 AM IST  ",Hold TCS; target of Rs 3200: Emkay Global Financial,"Emkay Global Financial's research report on TCSTCS delivered better than expected revenue growth in Q3, while margins came a tad below our expectations. Revenue grew 2.9% QoQ to USD7.1bn (2.2% CC) in a seasonally-soft quarter, driven by cloud, ERP and cyber security services as well as market-share gains through vendor consolidation. Continued traction in regional markets (~6% CC QoQ growth for a second quarter in a row; inherently more volatile) largely explains the revenue beat. Deal-closure activity (deal intake TCV of USD7.8bn; book-to-bill at 1.1x) exhibited some moderation due to slower decision-making, although the deal pipeline build-up has remained healthy so far. Management remains watchful in the near term, considering heightened macro uncertainties; however, it reiterated confidence on accelerating revenue growth, once uncertainties abate. We tweak our earnings estimates for FY23-25 (<1% cut) post the Q3 performance and special dividend outgo.OutlookTCS is well placed to navigate the challenging demand environment, considering its well-diversified offerings across growth & transformation and cost takeout & efficiency projects; but this seems to be largely captured in the valuation, in our view.

"  January 13, 2023 / 09:26 PM IST  ",Wipro CEO: Seeing shift in client priorities to deals that deliver rapid returns,"Wipro on January 13 reported a mixed bag in terms on numbers for Q3FY23, but while providing revenue growth guidance for the fourth quarter, the company said that would be in the range of -0.6 percent and 1 percent, which was below estimates.Despite this, Chief Executive Officer Thierry Delaporte said there was “no real reason to believe there is any slowdown in demand”. However, he added that there is uncertainty and a shift in client priorities.Wipro reported revenues of $2.8 billion for the quarter, up 0.2 percent sequentially. The company saw its large deals increase sequentially from last quarter’s $725 million to around $1 billion this quarter. It also saw total bookings of over $4.3 billion for the quarter.Delaporte said he believes clients continue to see technology as a driver of performance, and but that they may be shifting their priority to deals “that are delivering a rapid return on investment, are focusing on efficiency and possibly, also reducing or slowing down discretionary spending.”He maintained that Wipro expects to have a strong performance in bookings in the March quarter as well.When asked about the slowdown in verticals, Delaporte said, “There is no doubt. I think I will surprise nobody. Technology sector has known incredible growth over the last four quarters and years and is slowing down. It’s a reality…I would say possibly in the retail sector, particularly in America might see a potential slowdown.”On clients moving away from discretionary spends, he added that the macro uncertainty drives a “certain level of volatility”, and on that front, there is a lag in conversion.“Bookings look rather promising so far for Q4, there's no reason to believe that growth will not be here for the next quarters,” he said.On the possible degrowth in revenue for Q4 based on the guidance, Delaporte said that there is a certain level of uncertainty that is balanced by their volume of business. However, he maintained that while some clients are impacted, decision-making has not slowed down.He attributed it to a “potential lag that exists between the moment you win a contract and the conversion into revenue.”Chief Growth Officer Stephanie Trautman said that the company is seeing a lot of vendor consolidation: “One for simplification, and two for cost takeout”.She added that clients are seeing where they can optimise and get more value from either their current providers or new ones. They're looking for that value, especially in these economic times, she said.On slowing tech spends, Trautman said clients are trying to “spend wiser than they did before and really make sure that it adds value to their business”.",Wipro Ltd.
