"  January 19, 2023 / 06:32 PM IST  ",Budget 2023: HUL’s Sanjiv Mehta seeks extension in concessional tax rate timeline,"Sharing his expectations from the upcoming Budget 2023, Hindustan Unilever (HUL) CEO Sanjiv Mehta said he would like to see a further extension in timeline for the concessional 15 percent corporate tax rate for manufacturing companies.“India is a fabulous place for manufacturing. Increasing the concessional tax rate for companies by another five years will help India capitalize on the China+1 and Europe+1 opportunities,” HUL's Mehta said in a press meet.In September 2019, the government had said that any new domestic company incorporated on or after October 1, 2019, making fresh investment in manufacturing, would have an option to pay income-tax at the rate of 15 percent if they commenced their production on or before March 31, 2023.ALSO READ: Union Budget 2023: Two things FM Sitharaman must do to bring the bulls back to Dalal StreetThis deadline was later extended till March 2024, and going by Mehta’s wish list for Budget 2023, it should be extended till 2029.Second on his wish list is the simplification of capital gains tax. Currently, shares held for more than one year attract a 10 percent tax on long-term capital gains.Gains arising from sale of immovable property and unlisted shares held for more than 2 years and debt instruments and jewellery held for over 3 years attract 20 percent long term capital gains tax.“This complex structure must be simplified,” said Mehta.Reportedly, the revenue department is looking at rationalising the rates as well as the holding period for calculating these taxes and an announcement is likely on February 1.",Hindustan Unilever Ltd.

"  January 19, 2023 / 05:48 PM IST  ",Buy ICICI Pru Life; target of Rs 605: Emkay Global Financial,"Emkay Global Financial's research report on ICICI Pru LifeIPRU Life reported a decent 9MFY23 financial performance, led by positive surprise on VNB margin at 32% (vs our estimate of 30.6%) that gave Management the confidence to reiterate doubling of FY19 absolute VNB in FY23. Absolute VNB reported growth of 23.2% YoY for 9MFY23 at Rs17.1bn, driven by strong VNB margin (+4.9ppts YoY) and moderate APE growth (+4% YoY), beating our estimate by 5%. The sharp increase in margin is owing to increase in Non-Par saving, Annuity and Protection products in the product mix. Retail protection appears to be finally turning the corner, with Q3FY23 Retail protection APE rising sequentially and also exceeding Q4FY22 levels. On the distribution front, all channels, except ICICI Bank, are clocking satisfactory-to-strong performance. ICICI Bank’s share in the APE mix has gone down to ~18% in 9MFY23, but decline in the channel APE persists. Net net, developments in VNB margin, retail protection, non-ICICI Bank channel distribution and persistency afford increased confidence to the company, and the FY24 APE growth outlook holds the key for IPRU shares. Management appears positive about FY24 growth prospects, on grounds of the robust growth performance in agency and ex-ICICI Bank banca partnerships as well as the declining impact of ICICI Bank channel de-growth.OutlookAccounting for the developments in 9MFY23, we marginally tweak our FY23-25 estimates and reiterate our BUY rating, with our Dec-23E Target Price remaining unchanged at Rs605/share, implying FY24E P/EV of 2.1x. Post their underperformance over the past few years, IPRU shares are now valued at FY24E P/EV of 1.7x – still meaningfully undervalued versus peers and own history, and likely reflecting the negativity of the poor top-line growth and the muted expectation being already in the price. With the valuation relatively undemanding, we expect IPRU shares to re-rate, once top-line growth returns.For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.
