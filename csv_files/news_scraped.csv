Further it has crucial support in the 17,700-17,900 area. Hence, experts still hopeful that the Nifty may take out its January high soon.The benchmark indices fell half a percent each with the Nifty50 closing at 17,944 and the BSE Sensex at 61,003, while the broader markets were also under pressure with the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices declining 0.8 percent and 0.6 percent respectively.Stocks that we have selected today include Shree Cement, which climbed 2.5 percent to Rs 25,757, the highest closing level since May 2, 2022 and formed strong bullish candle on the daily charts with making higher high formation for fifth consecutive session.

Once a support, is currently a resistance which has been tested on three occasions.The stock has shown a strong bullish resolve in the last 3 weeks and breakout above the polarity zone is likely to aid fresh bullish momentum as the stock can head towards Rs 30,000-level. Key support is expected at Rs 24,000.IndusInd BankThe weekly chart shows resistance at the polarity point (Rs 1,200-mark). The stock is trading in an ascending triangle which is bullish pattern, but the stock has seen multiple failures to breach the level since last 5 months and continuing to sustain below the same doesn't augur well for the recovery move.

"  February 20, 2023 / 01:48 PM IST  ",Maggi “Chotu” price hike dents Nestle’s sales volumes and revenue growth in December quarter    ,"A small price hike appears to have impacted Nestle India’s sales volumes and revenue growth in the December quarter of 2022. The company raised prices of the Low Unit Pack (LUP) of Maggi noodles, also called Maggi “Chotu,” by Rs 2 during the quarter. That meant the 35-gram pack of noodles was priced at Rs 7 instead of the earlier Rs 5.So while net sales grew 14.2 percent to Rs 4,233.3 crore, led by pricing, analysts said the single percentage point volume decline in domestic sales during the quarter happened mainly due to the price hike in Maggi “Chotu.” LUPs account for nearly a fifth of Maggi portfolio sales and competitors did not follow Nestle in increasing prices of noodle LUPs.Also, though the growth in sales in mega cities — with a population of over 4 million — remained strong in the December quarter, ICICI Direct pointed out that it was anyway impacted by the Maggi “chotu” price increase. The same phenomenon was witnessed in towns with a population below 100,000, where sales growth fell largely because of the pricing action on Maggi “chotu,” the brokerage said.Chairman and Managing Director Suresh Narayanan said that in towns with less than 100,000 population, sales growth came down from 13 percent to 5 percent for the company in the December quarter. “This is where the pricing action in LUPs, especially in the noodles category, has had an impact. Price increase there has been close to 40 percent and this has clearly had an impact. But this is not something that wasn’t anticipated by the company. In fact, on a margin-accretive basis, uptrading has happened to single and multi-packs and that will help longer-term growth,” he said.Uptrading refers to change in consumer behaviour when bigger and pricier packs of the same product are bought by customers who were earlier opting for smaller packs.Sales growth remained strong in mega and large cities despite the “chotu” price increase, with metros and Tier I towns showing nearly 20 percent growth year-on-year (YoY).Q4 numbers Nestle India reported net profit of Rs 628.1 crore (Rs 567 crore) in the December quarter. In the year-ago period, there was a one-off exceptional expense of Rs 236.5 crore related to its employee benefit pension plan and adjusting for this one-off, the actual growth in net profit YoY was 10.8 percent. Else, growth was nearly 62 percent. And while the sales growth has remained in double digits for the entire calendar year (Nestle India tracks January-December), one look at the quarterly growth shows the decline — revenue grew the slowest in three quarters in December. Revenue growth had been 10.2, 16.1 and 18.2 percent in the first three quarters of the calendar year, as per an analysis by Motilal Oswal.Margins The company reported an over 240 basis point decline in YoY Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) margin to 22.1 percent from 24.5 percent even though the margin improved sequentially.Narayanan pointed out that 2022 was marked by severe commodity headwinds. Over the last six years, milk prices have gone up by 40 percent, wheat by nearly 30 percent, edible oils by a whopping 145 percent and even packaging material prices have shot up by 44 percent. These are considerably high numbers and even in January 2023, the Consumer Price Index inflation (CPI) was at 6 percent plus and food inflation was at 16 percent. He said that while the company was confident of mitigating these factors through cost saving measures and pricing action, some pressure will remain.Distribution focus Nestle India has expanded its direct distribution to 1.5 million outlets from 1.4 million while overall distribution network is now over five million outlets. This five million number is a build back from 2015, when the Maggi crisis had adversely impacted distribution. Narayan said during a call with analysts that Nestle’s rural play is just about 20 percent now but growth has been fairly strong at 25-26 percent. He also said that the company’s ambition was to expand its rural reach, in villages with a population above 2,000.“We want to grow our coverage to 120,000 villages with a population of above 2,000 by 2024. In 2022, we have already increased coverage to over 91,000 such villages. Our total village coverage stood at 165,367 villages in 2022 compared with 68,578 villages in 2020,” he added. From adding wholesalers and distribution touch points to scaling up activations at village fairs (Haats), the company is taking several measures to improve its visibility in rural regions.Capital expenditure Motilal Oswal noted that Nestle’s planned Rs 5,000 crore capital expenditure over the next three years is expected to boost volume growth, especially in prepared dishes (Maggi) and chocolates and confectionary over the medium term. The company’s overall volumes grew by 5 percent YoY and 6 percent in the domestic market. The brokerage said that “the long-term narrative for revenue and earnings growth is highly attractive.”“The Packaged Foods segment offers immense growth opportunities in India. This is particularly true for a company such as Nestle, which has a strong pedigree and distribution strength. The successful implementation of its volume-led growth strategy in recent years provides confidence in execution as well,” it added.",Nestle India Ltd.
"  February 20, 2023 / 07:46 AM IST  ",Top 10 picks for next 3-4 weeks as Nifty50 looks set to trade within a range,"The market seems to be inching upwards gradually along with a shift in support as the Nifty50 climbed higher for the third week in a row, rising half a percent in the week ended February 17. The index has formed a bullish candle with upper and lower shadows on the weekly scale, indicating volatility.Further, it has been making higher high for the week gone by, and higher low for second straight week. The index has breached the Budget day's high but there was some selling pressure at higher levels, leading to a close at 17,944.The Nifty50 has crucial support in the 17,700-17,900 area, hence as long as it holds the same, 18,200-18,300 appear likely in the coming sessions, experts said.Even the Options data indicated that 18,000 strike has maximum open interest on the Call as well as Put side, indicating a tug-of-war between bulls and bears.""The recent price action could be seen as a constructive development for our markets as the index hover above the sloping trendline and has also attempted to transcend the sturdy hurdle of the 18,000 mark after two weeks of consolidation,"" Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One, said.As far as levels are concerned, he remains hopeful till the sacrosanct support of 17,800-17,700 is withheld firmly. On the flip side, sustenance above 18,000 could only bring the cheer back in the market, while on the higher end, 18,200 is likely to be the sturdy wall in a comparable period, says Sameet.Despite the lacklustre moves in the indices, individual pockets kept buzzing and experts expect this to continue.Hence, Sameet advocate traders to focus on a stock-specific approach for better trading opportunities and stay with a similar buy on decline strategy till the time important supports are held comfortably.Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks.

Even though there was a weakness in the market, the stock held above the thin support line, otherwise it follows the market trend most of the time.Technically, we can call it as a bullish divergence, which will reward positional traders in a bullish move in the market. The strategy should be to buy 50 percent at current levels and balance at Rs 2,650. Place stop-loss at Rs 2,580. On the upside, there could be a rally towards Rs 2,850 or Rs 2,950 in the medium term.Tata Power Company: Buy | LTP: Rs 205 | Stop-Loss: Rs 190 | Target: Rs 230 | Return: 12 percentThe stock has been in the rectangle trading range for almost the last 15 months. It is following the trading range of Rs 190 and Rs 250. In the last eight weeks, the stock managed to stay above Rs 190 level, bucking the broad market trend, which had plunged to new lows.The reward-to-risk ratio at the current levels is in favour of the bulls. Buy Tata Power between Rs 205 and Rs 195. For this, keep the stop-loss at Rs 190. On the upside, the stock may move towards Rs 230 with facing minor resistance near Rs 220.Asian Paints: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,834 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,680 | Target: Rs 3,100 | Return: 9 percentThe stock has formed a higher bottom after touching highly oversold levels.

It touched the level of Rs 2,685, which was the higher bottom level compared to the previous low of Rs 2,560.Such type of pattern mostly favours the bulls, however, a breakdown of recent lows invites further weakness.Traders can take a tactical trading call at current levels and on the further downside and keep a tight stop-loss at Rs 2,680.
