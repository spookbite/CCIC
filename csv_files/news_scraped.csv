This was largely due to positive impact of price hike (~150bp) and cost savings (~80bp), higher spares sales (RE and VECV at +25% YoY each) offsetting lower exports (-30.5%/-22.5% YoY/QoQ at 9% of vols vs 12% QoQ). However, margins expansion ahead will be gradual ahead as stable RM and price hike (+1.5% in 2Q in domestic) would be partially offset by launch expense related to new Bullet 350 in Aug’23. While demand outlook is mixed/weak for domestic/exports, the management sounded confident to navigate increased competitive intensity by playing on RE’s strength developed over period of past decade. Further, it has hinted slew of disruptive launches (rather will be spaced out), which should help expand overall mid-size market.

Earnings beat at VECV was driven by better-thanexpected revenue growth even as margins were in line. Competition has significantly heightened in the 250-500cc segment post the recent launches by both Harley Davidson (in partnership with Hero MotoCorp) and Triumph (in partnership with Bajaj Auto) at extremely competitive and similar price points to RE. While their ambitions are likely to be much higher, even if both these peers together are able to ramp up to 10% of RE volumes over 6-9 months, it would cap RE’s future growth potential. Given the competitive aggression, we believe that RE would be forced to reconsider its pricing/brand strategy very quickly, which will in turn drive margin pressure.

After muted growth in the last couple of quarters, food delivery GOV jumped sharply, by 11.4% QoQ, led by demand recovery, growing adoption of Gold program that drove higher frequency of ordering, seasonality, and strong execution.

Management guides for over 60% YoY growth in Blinkit GOV (over 20% QoQ in Q2) and adj. EBITDA breakeven in the next four quarters. Overall adj. EBITDA also turned profitable for the first time, aided by strong revenue growth and cost levers, coupled with operating leverage.OutlookZomato expects adjusted revenue to grow at over 40% for at least the next couple of years and remain profitable going forward.
