While Gati lost nearly 17 percent, the AllCargo Logistics stock gained around 18 percent year to date.Gati has not found any takers from the mutual funds space so far, while AllCargo constitutes 2.5 percent of the Tata SmallCap Fund Geg (G) assets under management (AUM) and 0.75 percent of Quant Value Fund -Reg(G) AUM.According to Bloomberg, Gati has only two 'buy' recommendations from analysts, with no ratings on sell or hold. On the other hand, AllCargo Logistics, which owns more than 50 percent in Gati, has received four 'buy' calls, no 'hold' ratings, and one 'sell' rating.The romance of mutual funds and logistics stocks takes a twist when it comes to Delhivery. The stock has become a mutual fund darling with 51 funds holding it, though the company reported losses. These funds include SBI, Mirae, HDFC, Franklin, Nippon and ICICI. The stock has 'buy' ratings from 14 analysts, five has 'hold' tags and two suggest 'sell', according to Bloomberg.Recent reports suggested that Delhivery has started taking fancy on Gati and acquisition talks are at an early stage. As of March 2023, AllCargo Logistics has 50.2 percent stake in Gati Ltd which worth around Rs 780 crore.Delhivery has achieved a significant presence in the air cargo industry but it requires further reinforcement in the trucking business. Setting sights on Gati, which is known for its expertise in surface logistics and trucking, is a logical move for the company to firm up its position in this sector.Gati Ltd oversees a portfolio of five subsidiaries and operates as an integrated logistics firm with the primary focus on express distribution, contract logistics, e-commerce logistics, and fuel stations. The majority of Gati's revenue is derived from its express distribution and supply chain services.Gati, with three decades experience, caters to more than 19,800 pin codes, covering 735 out of 739 districts in India, while Delhivery reached out to 18,540 pin codes and AllCargo covers 99 percent of the India's pin codes.Delhivery's net loss widened to Rs 159 crore for the March quarter from Rs 119.80 crore a year ago after its revenue declined for the second straight quarter amid a slowdown in e-commerce.The company reported an operating income of Rs 1,859.6 crore for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, 10 percent lower than Rs 2,017 crore in the same period last year.  For the full year FY23 , Delhivery reported a 5 percent growth in operating revenue to Rs 7,225 crore as against Rs 6,882 crore a year ago.

It jumped 3.7 percent to Rs 3,385.8, the highest closing level since May 10 and formed a long, bullish candlestick pattern on the daily scale for second consecutive session.Here's what Rohan Shah of Stoxbox recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:Route MobileThe price action of Route Mobile supposedly took a breather by means of profit taking bouts after 282 percent run-up from the listing day. The price action corrected 56 percent from the all-time high and entered into a lateral trading range after losing the downside momentum.The current sideway trend not only hints at a more significant support level, but also that the ownership of stocks are potentially transferring from weak to strong hands.We thus reiterate going long in Route Mobile with entry in the range of Rs 1,475-1,435 with an upside move towards Rs 1,730-1,750 zone. On the flip side, Rs 1,377-1,360 to act key support area.Bajaj ElectricalsThe stock rallied almost more than 40 percent from the June 2022 low and post that stock turned sideways, trading in the channel which contained for more than 10 months.The stock staged a breakout from the said channel this week with strong volumes and supportive momentum. Thus going forward if breakout unfolds well on expected line, price is expected to head higher towards Rs 1,280-1,300 levels, whereas, Rs 1,190-1,170 shall provide key support zone.Divis LaboratoriesThe stock broke out of from descending resistance trendline in April 2023. After that stock went into consolidation mode for almost a month and now previous resistance zone acted as support for the stock.In last two days, the stock has been trading well above the support zone with good gains. However, 200 DEMA (day exponential moving average) has been another resistance point for stock on multiple instances. If stock closes above its 200 DEMA for the day, it will open up the targets of Rs 3,700 and Rs 3,900 respectively. On the other hand, the support will come at Rs 3,300 and Rs 3,240 levels.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.
