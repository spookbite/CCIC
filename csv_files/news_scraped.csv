"  May 30, 2023 / 06:12 AM IST  ",Head-to-Head: HUL and ITC stake equal claims to India's FMCG crown,"The maxim ‘form is temporary; class is permanent’ would be an apt description for India’s largest FMCG firm – Hindustan Unilever. Despite a muted Q4 show amid lingering inflationary headwinds, the analyst community’s love affair with the market heavyweight has only increased.Its more diversified peer ITC, on the other hand, posted stellar numbers, propelled by both cigarettes and staples. With more earnings visibility than its peers, ITC remains firmly ensconced at the top of market participants’ buy lists.But is there a case for choosing one over the other? Or does the ideal portfolio need the twin engines of both ITC and HUL? Here’s how these two stalwarts stack up -Financials: HUL’s Q4 numbers were marginally below expectations on most fronts, but it was the volume growth of just 4 percent which disappointed the Street. In fact, the 3 percent contraction in rural volumes accentuated the underlying pain points in the economy. Most analysts expect the trend to continue in the coming quarters.""We remain cautiously optimistic, expecting mid-single-digit volume growth as the near-term operating environment continues to be challenging. Considering price cuts and increased royalty rate at 3.45 percent, we trimmed our earnings and retain 'ADD' rating,"" Centrum Broking said.No such problems for ITC, whose FMCG business posted impressive figures on both growth and profitability fronts. Cigarette volumes shot up 12 percent YoY, helped also by clawback from illicit trade, while the hotels segment was lifted by the post-Covid revival in travel, which offset the weakness in paperboard and agribusinesses.""Unlike its staples peers, ITC has reported consistently impressive performance in its Other FMCG business (19 percent revenue growth and margin improvement despite elevated raw material costs), along with robust performance in Hotels. ITC’s earnings visibility remains better than peers,"" analysts at Motilal Oswal said.Market Moves: ITC shares have been hogging the limelight since the past year, and have emerged as the top Nifty gainer. HUL’s performance has been sedate in comparison. But a bit of context may be useful here -- HUL edges past ITC when it comes to their five-year returns.Analyst Views: Very little to choose between the two, as both companies feature prominently on ‘buy’ lists. With zero ‘sell’ calls, ITC has a near-perfect score on the sentiment meter, though HUL has reasserted its position with an increase in ‘buy’ ratings post the Q4 results.Valuations: HUL has traditionally commanded a higher price multiple than ITC, in line with most consumer staple firms. At a 1-year forward P/E of 52.69, HUL is trading well above its 10-year average of 46.5x.ITC’s price multiple of 25.4x too is above its 10-year average of 22.16. Incidentally, ITC has among the lowest P/E ratios in the Nifty FMCG index, mainly due to the tax overhang on cigarettes, though the situation may be turning favourable for the company.“The key challenges for ITC – an extremely punitive tax regime of the past, Covid-related disruption and commodity cost inflation – now seem to be receding,” according to Motilal Oswal.However, analysts said the ITC stock’s recent run-up limits its further rerating potential, which means the P/E gap with HUL is expected to remain in the medium term.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

The tourism and ticketing arm of the Indian Railways had posted a net profit of Rs 214 crore in the year-ago period.The company's revenue from operations increased 39.6 percent to Rs 965 crore for the quarter under review, as against Rs 691 crore in the same quarter last fiscal.The company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization or EBITDA was up 16.5 percent at Rs 324.6 crore in march quarter this fiscal as against Rs 278.5 crore in last fiscal, while the margin stood at 33.6 percent versus 40.3 percent (YoY).Moreover, the revenue from catering segment rose 49 percent year-on-year to Rs 396 crore versus Rs 266 crore in the March quarter, last year.Revenues from the Rail Neer segment jumped 33 percent to Rs 73 crore as against Rs 55 crore in the last-year period, while internet ticketing business rose to Rs 295 crore from Rs 293 crore in the last fiscal.ALSO READ: Options Trade | An earning-based non-directional options strategy in IRCTCIRCTC's board has also recommended a final dividend of Rs 2 per equity share of face value of Rs 2 each for the financial year 2022-23.Meanwhile, shares of IRCTC on May 29 closed 3.40 percent higher at Rs 645.60 apiece on BSE ahead of the earnings announcement.Moneycontrol's Pro Research team noted that IRCTC’s earnings in the first year, post-pandemic, show strong revival in most of the businesses – reflected in the 40 percent topline growth in the final quarter and 88 percent for the year.While internet ticketing held the fort during the pandemic, the revival in FY23 has been spearheaded by catering and tourism. The abolition of the 2S category had an impact on the ticketing business, especially in the second half.""The relatively lower share of internet ticketing business with extremely high margin, supressed the overall margin for the company. Q4 saw a sequential decline of 190 basis points in operating margin and for the year margin fell by more than 10 percent. Going forward, we expect the non-ticketing businesses to be the key growth drivers for IRCTC,"" it stated.",Indian Railway Catering And Tourism Corporation Ltd.

ONGC plans to align itself with India’s ambitious target to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to net zero by 2070.“The country’s energy demand will keep going up. It's not that fossil fuel demand in India will go down; for others, it may go down by 2030 but India will still see growing fossil fuel demand till 2040,” Singh said.“But we have to step up our effort for green energy so that at least 2070 we are net zero,” he said.Singh said that ONGC wants to focus on round-the-clock renewable energy projects and the company’s research centre is working on such solutions.“Battery storage would depend on how viable it is. Non-battery solutions are also an option; it is capital intensive which is something ONGC is very good at,” Singh said, explaining that the company is ready to commit capital to large-scale RTC projects.ONGC has signed a pact with the Rajasthan government to set up 5 GW of renewable energy projects and is on the lookout for opportunities to develop another 5GW. The company is exploring offshore wind energy projects and is keen to set up a 1 million tonne per annum capacity of Green Ammonia.In its traditional business, the company plans a capital expenditure of Rs 30,125 crore in 2023-24 as against Rs 30,208 crore in the previous year, financed primarily from internal accruals.",Oil & Natural Gas Corporation Ltd.
