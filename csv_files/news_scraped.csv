Meanwhile, sequentially, the net profit is expected to increase by 10.79 percent QoQ (quarter-on-quarter) from Rs 5,528 crore reported in the March quarter.Based on the mean consensus of the above-mentioned brokerage firms, Coal India is expected to report a revenue of Rs 34,501 crore in Q1FY24, which would be a 1.68 percent decrease YoY from Rs 35,902 crore reported in Q1FY23.

Sequentially, the margins are expected to increase by 1270 basis points from 11.1 percent reported in Q4FY23.Analysts expect a YoY decline in net profit for the quarter owing to softening in e-auction prices despite volumes for sale in the e-auction being higher. Meanwhile, Axis Securities expects EBITDA margin to decline on a YoY basis on account of higher input cost inflation.Sequentially, while the numbers for quarterly revenue and profit are expected to decline, the company has maintained a steady growth on its production front. In Q1FY24, Coal India reported a 10 percent YoY growth in the quarterly output at 175.5 million tonne. In the previous fiscal, the company had surpassed its own target of annual coal production at 703.4 million tonne.

"  August 08, 2023 / 03:12 PM IST  ","Gland Pharma locked in 20% upper circuit as brokerages see worst behind, recovery on the cards","Shares of Gland Pharma shot up 20 percent and were locked in the upper circuit at Rs 1,611.05 on August 8 after brokerages forecasted a recovery in the drugmaker's base business for the quarters ahead following the release of its April-June earnings.Gland Pharma reported a 41 percent increase in revenue for the April-June quarter, which brokerages see as an early sign of revival in its base business.Nonetheless, high depreciation and finance costs and weak operating margins dragged the drugmaker's bottomline 15.3 percent lower on-year to Rs 194.1 crore during the quarter under review.At 10.16 am, shares of Gland Pharma were trading at Rs 1,611.05 on the NSE, up 20 percent from the previous close.Follow our live blog for all the market actionRegardless of the weak bottomline, brokerages feel the 21 percent sequential recovery in the US market hints towards a point of turnaround for the drugmaker.Foreign brokerage Bernstein also seconded the view and believes revenues in the quarter gone by grew as the drugmaker consolidated two months of sales from its recently acquired Cenexi CMO in the European Union. Likewise, Jefferies also feels the improving pricing environmentin the US, momentum in new launches and roadmap for turnaround of Cenexi CMO indicate that worst is likely over for Gland Pharma.Moreover, Bernstein also pointed out that growth was seen in Gland Pharma's topline even after excluding contributions from Cenexi, backed by support from Europe, Rest of the World and India markets. The firm also saw some positives arising from Gland's performance in the US, namely, the rise in volumes for key products like Esmolol ( used to treat fast heartbeat and high blood pressure during medical procedures) and Caspofungin (a lipopeptide antifungal drug).Consequently, Bernstein retained its 'outperform' call on Gland Pharma with a price target of Rs 1,742. Jefferies was even more bullish on the stock, upgrading it to a 'buy' while raising its target price for the stock by 54 percent to Rs 1,640.Jefferies also increased its FY25-26 earnings-per-stock estimates by 5-7 percent as it pegged EPS CAGR (Compounded Annual Growth Rate) of 17 percent for Gland Pharma over FY23-26. Improving base business outlook, margin profile, stable pricing environment and possibilities of new business opportunities through Cenexi are reasons attributed by the brokerage for its bullish stance on the drugmaker.A similar optimism was shown by Motilal Oswal Financial Services as the firm also raised its earnings estimates by 8.5 percent/5.0 percent for FY24/FY25 to factor in a faster revival of the lost business by adding new customers, price stability in the base portfolio, and increase in milestone income.MOFSL not only sees the drugmaker on track to revive its base business but also to increase its offerings in newer markets like China, build a niche pipeline for regulated markets, and enhance the scope of synergy from Cenexi acquisition. The broking house has a 'buy' call on the stock with a price target of Rs 1,560.Another brokerage, Kotak Institutional Equities also sees green shoots of recovery from the company's improved performance of its base business on a sequential basis. Though the firm takes notice of the persisting concerns about the long-term growth and margin outlook, it highlighted that unlike its commentary in May this year, when Gland’s management had limited visibility on client-specific challenges among other issues, the company has now alluded to having greater visibility on the demand front.""In addition, higher confidence in the margin trajectory of the base business augurs well,"" KIE stated in its report. Taking confidence from the management's change in stance, KIE also upgraded the stock to 'reduce' from the earlier 'sell' along with a near 21 percent increase in its target price to Rs 1,300.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

The company will report its earnings later on August 8.Based on a poll by Bloomberg analysts, eight brokers anticipate a profit of Rs 1,509.60 crore, whereas nine project a revenue of Rs 42,560.70 crore. Hindalco reported a revenue of Rs 58,018 crore in the June 2022 quarter, when its net profit stood at Rs 4,119 crore.Analysts estimated the impact on Hindalco's earnings from copper sales because of the smelter shutdown from April 5 to mid-June at 10 percent on-year and a 7 percent on-quarter. Lower LME aluminum prices have also added to the decline, they said.The analysts' model foresees a 38 percent YoY reduction in EBITDA, primarily driven by a drop in revenues. On a QoQ basis, its EBITDA is likely to be 4 percent lower, mainly because of lower metal sales, which could be partly mitigated by lower input energy and coal prices. The EBITDA margins are expected to decrease year-on-year, while an on-quarter recovery is anticipated due to lower energy input costs.As per Nuvama Research findings, Hindalco's EBITDA, which also includes Utkal Alumina, is predicted to be 15 percent lower than that reported in the previous quarter, primarily due to a decreased realisation of aluminum prices. The cost of producing aluminum is expected to remain unchanged from the previous quarter from the accumulation of costly coal inventory.There is an estimated 2 percent decrease in aluminum production volume for the upcoming quarter. On a different note, the copper division is set to experience a more significant contraction, largely due to a 10 percent reduction in volumes compared to the previous quarter.In the previous week, Novelis disclosed that its revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 saw a 20 percent year-on-year decline, amounting to $4.1 billion. This revenue figure exceeded the analyst estimate of $3.7 billion by 10 percent on the back of enhancements in product composition, increased product pricing, and improved automotive shipments, partially offset by lower beverage can shipments and lower LME.Novalis adjusted EBITDA for the period down 25 percent year-on-year at $421 million, aligning with the analysts' anticipated value of $410 million. The EBITDA per tonne (EBITDA/t) reached $479, surpassing the projection of $445 per tonne by $34 a tonne. This improved per-tonne EBITDA was attributed to enhancements in the price/mix dynamics and gains from foreign exchange.The net profit is projected to decline 41 percent year-on-year, settling at $166 million. Remarkably, this figure exceeded analysts' earlier estimate of $149 million for the 1QFY24 by 11 percent.",Hindalco Industries Ltd.

"  August 08, 2023 / 09:44 AM IST  ",Torrent Pharma hits 52-week high as brokerages chart positive growth trajectory,"Shares of Torrent Pharmaceuticals rose over 2 percent in early trade on August 8 to hit a 52-week high of Rs 2,094.55, a day after the company reported healthy earnings for the April-June quarter. Following the earnings announcement, brokerages also rolled out a strong growth outlook for the drug maker, which further lifted sentiment.The company recorded a nearly 7 percent on-year rise in net profit for the quarter while revenue grew 10.4 percent during the same period. Industry-beating growth of 14.5 percent in domestic formulations coupled with an increase in sales in Brazil and Germany helped the company offset weak revenues from its US business.Revenues for the drugmaker's US business fell 2 percent on year due to price erosion on the base portfolio and lack of new launches due to pending inspection of facilities.Regardless, brokerages are pinning hopes on Torrent's strong domestic presence to drive numbers in the quarters to come as they painted a robust growth trajectory for the drugmaker.At 09.30 am, shares of Torrent Pharmaceuticals were trading at Rs 2,063.65 on the NSE, up about a percent from the previous close.Follow our live blog for all the market actionForeign brokerage Jefferies also backs that view and believes Torrent's presence in the domestic branded market and a recovery in Germany will remain key growth drivers for the drugmaker. The firm also sees a steady EBITDA margin expansion of 600-100 basis points per annum as another growth lever for the company. Jefferies has a 'hold' rating for the stock, with a price target of Rs 1,950.Nuvama Institutional Equities is equally enthusiastic over Torrent Pharma's branded-franchise-led growth potential as it expects the drugmaker's market-beating volume growth to lead the prescription medicine segment. Nuvama also sees huge growth potential in Torrent's over-the-counter portfolio, given its strong product mix.Consequently, the firm raised its multiple to 35 times Q1 FY26 expected earnings for Torrent Pharma on the back of domestic growth and margin headroom. The firm also raised its target price for the stock to Rs 2,410 while retaining a 'buy' call on the stock.Motilal Oswal Financial Services also raised its earnings-per-stock estimates for FY24/FY25 by 4 percent each to factor in a reduced intensity of price erosion in US generics, product launches, market share gains in Latin America, and improving growth prospects in Germany.The brokerage also feels Torrent is on track to outperform in the domestic formulations segment through price hikes, increasing reach and enhancing brand value by building a consumer healthcare franchise. Moreover, a faster pace of launches in Brazil should help Torrent sustain the growth momentum, the firm believes.However, MOFSL still chose to retain its 'neutral' stance on the stock, with a price target of Rs 1,960 as it believes the rich valuations at the current levels factor in the earnings upside over the next 2-3 years.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.
