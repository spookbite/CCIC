However, the bank has utilised contingent buffers worth Rs. 31 crore during the quarter. NII growth was strong at 41% y-o-y/6% q-o-q, in line with advances growth. NIM was stable q-o-q at 6.2%. Core other income was up by 7% y-o-y/17% q-o-q, driven by healthy growth in disbursements, increasing contribution of bancassurance income, and rising share of transactional customers on the liability side. Operating profit grew by 21% y-o-y/11% q-o-q, led by strong revenue growth, but was offset by rising costs. Asset-quality performance remained strong with credit costs at just 0.24%, with lower slippages q-o-q (12%) and improvement in NPL ratios — GNPL at 1.81% and NNPL at 0.51%. The bank is comfortably placed with ~72% provision coverage on NPLs and excess loan provision of ~40 bps.OutlookThe near to medium-term outlook looks stable to positive for the bank, except for cost of funds. The stock is currently trading at 3.8x/3.4x/2.9x its FY2023E/FY2024E/FY2025E ABV estimates, respectively. We maintain Buy with an unchanged PT of Rs. 800.

NBM is a system used by insurers to measure the cost of and profit from writing new policies.Successful journey on NBMsHDFC Life has delivered superior NBMs for several quarters now, and this has supported its valuations in the market. For Q2FY23, the life insurer’s margin was 25.8 percent.A superior product mix, with a healthy share of margin-friendly protection business, has been behind the insurer’s stellar numbers.“New business premium to see a healthy growth; expect strong trends in annuity/non-par (non-participatory) segments,” wrote analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.Analysts at Jefferies India Pvt Ltd expect the life insurer’s strong growth to drive profitability for the quarter. HDFC Life witnessed a 15 percent growth in new business on an annualized premium equivalent (APE) basis for the December quarter, as per company-wise business data from the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA).The company’s APE stood at Rs 2,990 crore, as of December. The 15 percent expansion comes over a 20 percent growth in the corresponding quarter last year, an indication that the life insurer has been able to boost its business.“HDFC Life seems to have turned the corner on growth, with a 23 percent individual APE growth, following a 47 percent growth in November 2022 after a few weak (-17% to +15%) ones in the preceding five months,” noted analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities in a January 9 report.To be sure, part of the growth is also due to the acquisition of Exide Life that concluded in October. Exide Life’s product book performance would be a key monitorable for investors. The management’s outlook on growth in the coming quarters as well as improvement in persistency ratios will also be keenly watched.",HDFC Life Insurance Company Ltd.

"  January 20, 2023 / 10:55 AM IST  ",ICICI Bank Q3 Preview: Expect a robust all-round act; 29% net profit growth,"ICICI Bank Ltd is expected to deliver a robust set of operating metrics for the December quarter, powered by a strong loan growth, core interest income expansion and reduction in stressed loans.The private sector lender is expected to report a net profit of Rs. 7,994 crore for the quarter, up 29 percent from a year ago period, the average estimate of seven securities firms showed. Net interest income (NII) is expected to have grown 28 percent Year-on-Year (YoY) to Rs 15,639 crore for the three months ended December.The bank will detail its quarterly earnings on January 21.The healthy growth in NII is expected on the back of double-digit loan growth and an expansion in the net interest margin. Coupled with traction in non-interest r income, the bank is expected to report an operating profit of Rs 12,193 crore, a YoY increase of 20 percent.ICICI Bank’s loan book has expanded around 20 percent consistently for several quarters now and analysts expect the bank to have repeated this performance in the December quarter as well.  “Loan growth to be solid at 20%, led by healthy contribution from all segments,” wrote analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities in a note.  In the September quarter, the lender had reported 23 percent growth in its corporate loans and 25 percent expansion in retail loans.In an interaction with analysts earlier this month, the bank’s management laid out its plans for faster business growth and reduction in costs by relying heavily on technology and digitization. The bank has multiple times pushed its digital heft through a super app that provides prospective and existing customers with a full stack of products of the ICICI Group as well as other financial companies.Some of these efforts may reflect in the credit growth number of the bank for the third quarter as well. Further, ICICI Bank’s management also indicated its focus on loans to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) during public interactions in the previous quarters.“As highlighted in our recent notes, we see strong opportunity for ICICI Bank in SME space where it has customised offerings for micro-segments and offered many firsts to clients,” analysts at Jefferies India Pvt Ltd wrote in a note. SME loans form 4.4 percent of the bank’s total book. Retail and SME loans fetch more bang for the buck as they carry wider spreads compared with loans to large companies.Margin heftBanks hiked deposit rates sharply during the December quarter and ICICI Bank was not an outlier. Ergo, the lender is likely to have witnessed an increase in its cost of funds. The bank’s margins have expanded for three straight quarters now and may show a marginal increase in the December quarter as well despite headwinds from deposit rate hikes.“Margins would continue to expand however at a slower rate, as CoF goes up,” analysts at Prabhudas Lilladher wrote in their note. CoF is short for cost of funds. The lender had hiked its deposit rates thrice during the quarter by 50-100 basis points across tenures. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.Analysts believe that the mix of its loan book and a slower repricing of its deposits limit the impact on margins unlike some of its smaller peers. The share of low-cost current and savings accounts for ICICI Bank is high, at 45 percent as of the September quarter. As stated earlier, the bank’s loan mix has tilted towards retail and small businesses that are conducive to margins. Further, within retail, the bank has grown its unsecured personal loan book faster than the other categories, which supports margins.Stress out of sightAnalysts expect the bank to report a reduction in fresh slippages for the quarter, thereby bringing down its provisioning needs. The gross bad loan pile is expected to decrease on an aggregate level as well. In the September quarter, the bank had reported a gross bad loan ratio of 3.19 percent, a sharp fall from 4.82 percent a year ago.“We expect provisions to remain at low levels, given lower slippages and better trends on recovery/upgradation. We are building in slippages of 2% (Rs.50 billion), but we see a solid commentary on recovery to continue resulting in lower stress coming from asset quality perspective,” the Kotak note said.",ICICI Bank Ltd.

Downstream chemical products witnessed margin pressure with excess supply and relatively weak regional demand,"" said Mukesh Ambani.The business recorded revenue at Rs 1.44 lakh crore for the quarter ended December FY23, growing 10 percent over the corresponding period last fiscal led by higher price realisation as crude oil prices went up by 11 percent.The topline growth was constrained by lower throughput with planned maintenance and inspection activity turnaround during the quarter, the company said.EBITDA for the O2C segment at Rs 13,926 crore grew by 2.9 percent on-year supported by strength in middle distillate cracks.""EBITDA was, however, partially offset by weak margins across polymer, polyester chain and light distillates products.

The company had reported a net profit of Rs 20,539 crore in the same quarter last year.

Revenue was expected to rise 21 percent YoY to Rs 2.23 lakh crore.The company said its EBITDA increased by 13.5 percent YoY to Rs 38,460 crore ($4.6 billion), on account of strong growth in the subscriber base for its digital business, growth across consumption baskets, improvement in middle distillate cracks and higher gas price realisation with an increase in ceiling price, and marginally higher volumes in the Oil & Gas segment.Also Read: Reliance Retail's Q3 revenue jumps 17%, net profit up 6.2% on highest ever footfalls""All segments contributed to the robust growth in consolidated EBITDA on a YoY basis,"" said Mukesh D.

EBITDA increased 2.9 percent to Rs 13,926 crore.Commenting on the energy vertical, group Joint CFO V Srikanth said, “Energy businesses accounted for 70% of incremental growth on a quarter-on-quarter basis.” He said that the oil and gas segment maintained stable production and higher realisation led to higher contribution.”Revenues increased on account of higher price realisation as crude oil prices went up by 11 percent year-on-year, said the company in a press release. Revenue growth was constrained by lower throughput with planned Maintenance & Inspection activity turnaround during the quarter. Srikanth added, “Volatile price environment and weak demand from China impacted downstream margin.”Growth in EBITDA was supported by strength in middle distillate cracks. This was, however, partially offset by weak margins across polymer, polyester chain and light distillates products. Continued SAED (special additional excise duty) on transportation fuels also impacted earnings by Rs 1,898 crore, RIL added.The company sees Middle Distillate cracks to remain firm on lower inventories, seasonal demand, and the impending loss of Russian oil products. Meanwhile, petrochemical feedstock price volatility will likely continue amidst uncertain geopolitical situations and recessionary trends in developed economies, it said.Srikanth attributed the quarter-on-quarter 12% decline in crude oil prices to demand and recession fears in Europe, the USA. However, the official added, India’s demand for fuels and downstream products remained strong even as global demand declined.RIL management said that the global oil demand is estimated to grow by 1.9 million barrels per day in 2023, led by the US, China and India. Srikanth said that some of the new capacity that will be commissioned in the second half of 2023r would result in an effective net global refining capacity addition of around 1 million barrels per day, so while their margin will get some support, the upside would be limited.Oil & GasThe company’s outlook for the gas market remains positive. “Gas price realization is expected to remain high in near-time even though some cool-off has happened,” said Sanjay Roy, Senior Vice President –exploration and production at RIL.The average gas price realised for KGD6 was at $11.3/MMBTU in 3QFY23 vs $6.1/MMBTU in 3Q FY22, with the raising of gas price ceiling to $12.46/MMBtu by the Government of India.RIL said geopolitical uncertainty and constrained supply are likely to keep gas prices firm in the near term while incremental production and higher prices will support EBITDA growth in the near term.MediaNet profit for its media business was at Rs 9 crore, down 97.1 percent YoY. Revenue from operations, meanwhile, increased 11.6 percent to Rs 1,850 crore primarily driven by the movies and sports business amidst a challenging advertising environment.RIL Q3 Earnings Highlights: Revenue up 15% YoY; board approves Rs 20,000 crore fundraisingThe continued softness in the macroeconomic environment dampened the advertising demand and ad revenue of all our segments was down on a YoY basis, RIL said.
