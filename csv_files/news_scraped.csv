"  August 12, 2023 / 11:07 AM IST  ",Buy Coal India; target of Rs 270: Sharekhan,"Sharekhan's research report on Coal IndiaQ1 results were strong with a sharp 36% beat in consolidated PAT at Rs. 7,971 crore (up 44% q-o-q) led by better-than-expected margin given significantly lower employee cost and a marginally higher blended realization partially offset by lower other income. FSA/e-auction realisation of Rs. 1,536/Rs. 3,742 per tonne was 2%/30% above our estimate. E-auction premium of 144% was lower q-o-q but was above expectation of 90%. Coal offtake of 187mt (up 5% y-o-y; flat q-o-q) with FSA/e-auction volume at 168 mt/16mt, flat q-o-q. Soft international coal prices would lower e-auction realisations, while we expect Coal India (CIL) to take FSA coal price hike to offset higher cost. Also, coal production/offtake has witnessed strong growth of 10%/6% y-o-y during April-July 2023. Overall, we expect healthy earnings momentum to sustain although it would moderate compared to peak PAT seen in FY23.OutlookValuation of 5.6x its FY25E EPS (close to trough valuation) is attractive and the stock offers a high dividend yield of ~10%. Hence, we maintain a Buy on Coal India with an unchanged PT of Rs. 270. Potential stake sale in Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL) and subsequent listing would unlock value.For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

The same will be compensated in upcoming quarters with commencement of additional production from new projects; especially by crude oil production commencement from KG 98/2 in Q3 2023-24,” the company said.In the first quarter of FY24, ONGC declared total four discoveries (1 in onland and 3 in offshore) in its operated acreages.

Zee’s subscription revenue was up 3 percent in FY23 whereas Sony’s grew 15 percent YoY. “Sony outperformed Zee (in FY23) due to strength in the urban genre, sports properties, and OTT (over-the-top platform) price hikes,” said Karan Taurani, senior vice-president, Elara Capital.How the numbers stack upIn the television vertical, Sony and Zee had a market share of 9.1 percent and 10.4 percent, respectively, in FY23. Hence, the combined entity recorded a total market share of 19.4 percent.Sony’s ad revenue market share stood at 10.7 percent and its subscription revenue market share was 8 percent. As for Zee, its ad and subscription revenue market share stood at 13.3 percent and 8.4 percent, respectively.The subscription market share of the combined entity stood at 16.4 percent in FY23. The merged entity, with 24 percent market share in advertising revenue, is only behind Star-Disney, which has a 33 percent share.On the streaming front, Sony India’s OTT platform SonyLIV currently has 33.3 million subscribers, while Zee’s streaming arm Zee5 reported 112 million average monthly active users (MAU) and 11.3 million daily active users (DAU) in FY23. According to industry estimates, Zee5’s subscriber base is pegged in the range of 5-10 million.In terms of financials, Sony recorded a profit after tax (PAT) of Rs 1,042 crore in FY23, up 6 percent YoY, whereas Zee’s PAT stood at Rs 251.4 crore, down 76 percent YoY. “Zee faced pressure mainly due to the content cost and its investments in digital,” Taurani noted.Zee’s and Sony’s combined revenue stood at Rs 14,772 crore in FY23.The combined entity’s annual revenue is estimated to be about $2 billion, said Mihir Shah, India head at Media Partners Asia, an advisory and consulting group. He added that the merged entity has an opportunity to scale in sports and streaming, especially with the $1.5 billion funding that will come after the merger.Merger clearedZee and Sony received approval for their merger from the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on August 10, after seven months. Within 30 days of the NCLT order, Zee will have to intimate the registrar of companies, after which the company’s shares will be delisted from stock exchanges and re-listed in another six weeks, said legal experts.The combined entity’s board of directors will also need clearance from the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.
