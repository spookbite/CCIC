However, there is no such requirement, it added.In September 2022, after completion of Holcim stake acquisition, the group pledged entire stakes in Ambuja Cements (63.2 percent) and in ACC (56.7 percent), worth about Rs 96,800 crore, with Deutsche Bank’s Hong Kong branch, stock disclosures showed. However, data as of December-end indicated zero promoter pledge.""The promoters have only provided non-disposal undertaking and accordingly, there is no requirement of providing any top-up of shares of Ambuja and ACC or cash top up under the acquisition financing raised last year,"" clarified the group.Also Read: RBI looking at banks' exposure to Adani group companies, seeks present status: SourcesApart from the two cement stocks, rest of the Adani pack continued their downfall.

The subscription for the FPO closed successfully yesterday. Despite the volatility in the stock over the last week, your faith and belief in the Company, its business and its management has been extremely reassuring and humbling.

Given these extraordinary circumstances, the Company’s board felt that going ahead with the issue will not be morally correct. The interest of the investors is paramount and hence to insulate them from any potential financial losses, the Board has decided not to go ahead with the FPO.""The company is working with its Book Running Lead Managers (BRLMs) to refund the proceeds received by it in escrow and to also release the amounts blocked into investors' bank accounts for subscription to this issue.Adani Enterprises crashed over 26 percent to close at Rs 2,180.20 apiece on BSE amid report that Credit Suisse has stopped accepting bonds of Adani companies as collateral for margin loans.

The research firm also raised concerns about high debt and the valuations of the seven listed Adani companies.Adani Group has denied the allegations, saying the short-seller's narrative of stock manipulation has ""no basis"" and stems from an ignorance of law. It has always made the necessary regulatory disclosures, it added.The FPO, which by the end, saw 112 percent subscription, thanks to a big push from HNI investors on the final bidding day delivered a tepid performance with the retail investors.In his statement, Gautam Adani also added that the decision will not have any impact on the company's existing operations.""Our balance sheet is very healthy with strong cashflows and secure assets, and we have an impeccable track record of servicing our debt. This decision will not have any impact on our existing operations and future plans. We will continue to focus on long term value creation and growth will be managed by internal accruals. Once the market stabilizes, wewill review our capital market strategy. We are very confident that we will continue to get your support. Thank you for your trust in us,” Adani said.“It’s unusual for a secondary offering like this to be canceled,” said Ben Silverman, director of research at VerityData told Bloomberg. “Pulling an offering at the last minute doesn’t inspire a lot of confidence right now.”“The Adani family might need to pledge more shares given the drop in share prices, though they could still maintain a healthy headroom with the portion pledged at no more than 40%, based on our calculation,” Sharon Chen, credit analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, wrote in a note.",Adani Enterprises Ltd.

Earlier in the day, it had hit an all-time high of Rs 384.70 apiece.Follow our market blog for all the actionSmoke signalsThe stock corrected 6 percent as Sitharaman said the NCCD duty on cigarettes was hiked by 16 percent. The reaction was overdone as the Street soon realised that the total tax component on a cigarette stick goes up by only 1-2 percent, said analysts.The NCCD is a part of the total tax levied on cigarettes. The total tax burden (taxes as a percentage of final tax inclusive retail price) is about 52.7 percent for cigarettes, which includes GST, excise duty as well as NCCD. NCCD is about 10 percent of the overall tax.The World Health Organization recommends a total tax of 75 percent on tobacco products.According to Nuvama Institutional Equities, ""The tax increase is lower than Street’s/ours expectations, and we expect legal cigarette players to gain share from the illegal ones."" This means higher volumes for ITC.Cigarette companies will need to raise prices by 2-3 percent, which is not a big ask and can be easily passed on, analysts said.Analysts at JM Financial believe the move can re-rate the stock further. ""We expect ITC to accordingly adopt an approach that could also drive its premiumisation agenda and further increase its relative positioning in the industry,"" the brokerage firm said in a report.It has upped its target multiple on the stock from 23x to 25x price-to-earnings ratio.

Also it has taken a strong support at 200 DMA (daily moving average - 17,300). Further it has still respected long upward sloping support trendline adjoining lows of March 2020 and June 2022, while on the weekly scale, it has so far defended 50 WEMA (weekly exponential moving average - 17,400).Overall it was a volatile session for the market and the index has been rangebound. Unless and until above support levels get decisively broken, there is no cause of worry, but volatility is likely to continue with resistance at 17,800-18,000 area, experts said.""The pivotal zone of 17,500 was firmly safeguarded, which implies the significance of the support, followed by the sacrosanct support of 200 SMA which is placed around 17,300.

"  February 02, 2023 / 02:02 PM IST  ",Car sales start on a positive note this year,"As the first month of this calendar year ended, most carmakers saw double-digit growth in volumes. Auto industry observers anticipated robust growth in sales across categories, barring the two-wheeler segment, due to pent-up demand and abatement of the semiconductor shortage.While new launches and healthy order books for SUVs such as the Maruti Suzuki Jimny boosted numbers, the transition to BS-VI phase-2 emission norms is likely to cause some disruption in dispatches from dealerships, said some analysts.Maruti Suzuki India Ltd (MSIL) reported cumulative sales of 172,535 units during January 2023, a year-on-year growth of 11.7 per cent. Total sales in the month include domestic sales of 151,367 units, sales to other OEMs of 3,775 units and exports of 17,393 units.“The shortage of electronic components had a minor impact on the production of vehicles, mainly in domestic models. The Company took all possible measures to minimise the impact,” MSIL said in a statement.Hyundai Motor India’s total sales stood at 62,276 units, up 16.6 per cent year-on-year compared to the 53,427 vehicles sold in January 2022. The company’s domestic sales grew nearly 14 per cent to 50,106 units, while exports went up by over 29 per cent to 12,170 units.Tarun Garg, chief operating officer, Hyundai Motor India Ltd, said, “We have begun CY2023 on a high note recording double-digit growth in the month of January.”Tata Motors sold 48,289 units of passenger vehicles last month, which is an 18 percent jump from the 40,942 units sold in January 2022. The company’s domestic passenger vehicle sales (including electric vehicles) rose 18 percent to 47,987 units, while exports grew 83 per cent to 302 units.Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M) sold 33,040 passenger vehicles in January 2023, a 65 percent growth in sales vis-à-vis 19,964 units sold during the same month last year. Last month, the Mumbai-based automaker sold 32,915 utility vehicles (SUVs and MPVs), up 66 percent, while the sale of cars and vans (including EVs) stood at 125 units, a growth of 8 percent.Veejay Nakra, president, automotive division, M&M, said, “The successful launches of Thar RWD and our first all-electric SUV, XUV400, have received a very encouraging response from our customers in the first month of 2023.”Toyota Kirloskar Motors (TKM) posted a 175 percent growth over January 2022. The carmaker reported wholesale despatches of 12,835 units in January 2023, up from 7,328 units in the same month a year ago.Atul Sood, vice president, sales and strategic marketing, TKM, said, “Calendar year 2022 ended on a positive note for Toyota Kirloskar Motor. As the company clocked the highest wholesale in the last decade, we have stepped into the New Year with much excitement and optimism.”MG Motor India, however, saw a decline in January 2023 as the company sold 4,114 units in India, a year-on-year drop of 4.45 per cent compared to 4,306 units registered in the corresponding period last year.“With some improvement in the supply chain, production is regaining momentum.  However, select variants of the manufacturer still remain impacted,” the company said in a statement.",Maruti Suzuki India Ltd.

Chemical EBIT margin expansion by 384 bps q-o-q was led by pricing benefit from contract renewal, softness in input cost, and ramp-up of new product launches. Chemical EBIT grew by 35% y-o-y/9% q-o-q and was well above our expectation, led by beat of 4%/410 bps in revenue/margin, given sustained strong traction in specialty chemical/fluorochemicals business. Packaging film’s EBIT margin witnessed decent q-o-q recovery of 224 bps to 10%, while revenue remained muted on soft BOPET/BOPP demand/price. Technical textile continues to see earnings pressure (EBIT down 70% y-o-y/46% q-o-q) on subdued NTCF/polyester industrial yarn demand. Management remains confident of sustained chemical segment margin in Q4FY2023, given sustained strong ref-gas price and ramp-up of MPP4/Chloromethane plant. Packaging film margin is expected to remain weak, given pressure in BOPET/BOPP spreads. FY2023 capex guidance is maintained at Rs. 3,000 crore and aims for Rs. 2,800-3,000 crore for FY2024.OutlookThe recent sharp 24% fall in the stock price provides a good entry opportunity for investors as earnings outlook remains strong for the key chemical segment and valuation of 24.4x/21.5x its FY2024E/FY2025E EPS has turned reasonable.
