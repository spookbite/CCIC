"  July 20, 2023 / 08:24 PM IST  ","HUL expects price growth to be flat or negative in coming quarters, all eyes on volumes","Hindustan Unilever, on July 20, said that if commodity prices remain where they are, its price growth will be flattish-to-negative in the coming quarters. The company expects topline growth to be purely volume-led in the next 2-3 quarters.Fast-moving consumer goods companies take price hikes when raw material costs spike. This helped HUL post double-digit sales growth till Q4 FY23.Now that input costs have tempered down after the sharp surge during the Ukraine-Russia war, HUL has been passing on the benefit to consumers by cutting prices. HUL's pricing actions have mainly come in the personal care and home care portfolio, i.e., soaps and detergents.For the quarter ended June 2023, HUL reported a standalone net profit of Rs 2,472 crore, up 8 percent year-on-year. Revenue grew 7 percent YoY to Rs 15,333 crore, of which 3 percent was volume growth, and the rest was price-led.However, the 3 percent volume growth was below Street expectations of 5-6 percent. ""Consumption usually recovers after a lag when we are coming out of tough times. That said, we are laser-focused on volume growth,"" said Rohit Jawa, chief executive officer, and managing director of HUL. Jawa took over as the top boss of India's largest consumer company on June 27.Breaking down the volume growth in different categories, Ritesh Tiwari, chief financial officer of HUL, explained that home care, as well as BPC (beauty and personal care categories), saw mid-single-digit volume growth. It was the food and refreshment portfolio that dragged down overall volumes. The F&R segment saw near-flat volume growth as consumers downgraded from premium tea to loose tea.Focus on volumesTo focus on volumes, the company is looking at increasing penetration in categories such as health and well-being, health food drinks (HFD) and masstige. Masstige stands for mass-produced, relatively inexpensive goods that are marketed as luxurious or prestigious.""It is not that HUL has under-penetration in these categories. The market itself has to be developed first,"" explained Tiwari in a press conference.To this, Jawa added that HUL is over-indexed on premium products, which contributes one-third of the top line. ""This segment is growing at least 50 percent faster,"" he said.In the masstige category, HUL scaled up the reach of some Love Beauty and Planet, and Simple. The company took Simple to offline shops as well. Meanwhile, in the HFD category, Boost was taken nationally.Rural demandFor HUL, rural volume growth finally turned positive in the June quarter, albeit on a soft base. ""Weather-related risks continue and El-Nino's impact on inflation and rural demand has to be monitored. However, increased government capex and growing remittances keeps us positive on rural demand,"" said Tiwari.To ensure sustainable volume growth in rural markets, HUL continues to play the price-value equation. This comes at a time when small, regional players have re-emerged in select categories like tea and detergent bars.The bottom line is the company remains positive that volume growth will drive topline in coming quarters as the trade channels gradually de-stock all high-price inventory. As low-price inventory comes on shelves, they expect volumes to increase.""Competitive volume growth is our goal,"" said Jawa.",Hindustan Unilever Ltd.

I am confident of the medium to long term prospects of the Indian FMCG sector and HUL’s ability to deliver a Consistent, Competitive, Profitable and Responsible growth.,"" he added.During the press conference the FMCG's new MD and CEO expressed, ""My  intention going forward is to take current initiatives such as premiumisation, digitalisation, sustainability and go deeper into these initiatives.""This signals that there will be continuity in strategy after taking over from Sanjiv Mehta as the chief of India's FMCG bellwether.

This means an investor who bought RIL shares on July 19, is deemed to have paid Rs 133 (i.e 4.68 percent of Rs 2,853 closing price) for Jio Financial Services.Thus, those investors are sitting on 100 percent gains currently.Explaining further, Chartered Accountant and taxation expert Suresh Anchaliya said that the cost of acquisition of shares of JFS will be 4.68 percent of when it was actually purchased and to that extent, the cost of acquisition of shares of RIL (post demerger) will be reduced.So, if an investor had bought the conglomerate's shares at a 52-week low of Rs 2,180 in March, then JFS' cost is Rs 102 and RIL's cost is Rs 2,078.This will help investors calculate their capital gains tax. However, the taxability will arise only at the time of the sale of shares by the investor, added Anchaliya.Investors must note that they cannot sell JFS shares at the moment. Currently, JFS will remain at a constant price in all the indices where RIL is present. The company is yet to announce the allotment and listing date. On the listing date, JFS' share price could be higher or lower than Rs 261 based on the pre-open session that will be conducted by exchanges on that day.According to the scheme of the arrangement, shareholders of RIL will get 1 share of the demerged entity for every 1 share held by them in the conglomerate.Disclaimer: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.
