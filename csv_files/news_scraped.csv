"  March 13, 2023 / 07:11 AM IST  ","Trade Spotlight | Your strategy for Adani Green Energy, Swan Energy, JBM Auto today","Bears took the full control of Dalal Street on March 10 and dragged the benchmark indices down by 1 percent for yet another session after worries in the US banking space. Here also banking and financial services turned out to be the major culprit behind correction in the market.The BSE Sensex tanked nearly 700 points to 59,135, while the Nifty50 plunged around 180 points to 17,413 and saw the formation of a hammer kind of candlestick pattern on the daily charts. Generally, this is a bullish reversal pattern, hence we need to see the trend in the coming sessions.The broader markets also joined bears but the correction was less compared to benchmarks. The breadth was in favour of bears as about two shares declined for every rising share on the NSE.The Nifty Midcap 100 index was down 0.75 percent and Smallcap 100 index fell 0.9 percent.However, stocks that outperformed the broader markets included Adani Green Energy which was locked in 5 percent upper circuit for eighth consecutive session after taking support at around Rs 439 on February 28. The stock closed at Rs 682.7, rising 55 percent in last eight sessions in a row, and the volume on last Friday was above average volumes.Swan Energy was also in action, climbing over 7 percent to Rs 298 and formed long bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts with robust volumes. The stock got back above all key moving averages (9, 50, 100 and 200 EMA), with higher high higher low formation, which is a positive sign.JBM Auto shares rose nearly 3 percent to Rs 643, the highest closing level since January 21, 2022, continuing uptrend for third consecutive session and trading well above key moving averages. The stock has formed small bodied bullish candlestick pattern with long upper shadow on the daily charts, which resembles Shooting Star kind of pattern (though not the exact one).Here's what Foram Chheda of ChartAnalytics.co.in recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:Swan EnergyAfter marking a top near Rs 374 levels, the stock price of Swan Energy witnessed a steep corrective decline. This decline halted near Rs 248 levels which coincided with the 200-day MA (moving average). The stock price rebounded which led to the development of consolidation.Recently, the stock price made a breakout from this defined consolidation; resulting in the upside momentum. Following a breakout, the stock price retested the breakout level, indicating a resumption of the up move. This price move is attempting to move above 50-day MA (Rs 298) and is accompanied by an exponential increase in volume; supporting the bullishness in the stock.Thus, breakout levels at Rs 283-285 are attractive to buy with a potential upmove close to 8.7 percent and stop-loss of Rs 274.JBM AutoJBM Auto marked a high of Rs 674 in January 2022; a downtrend followed after that which found a base after the formation of a double-bottom in Rs 362-368 zone. The uptrend that follow saw the stock crossing above the 50-, 100-, and 200-day MA indicating the underlying trend to be bullish.The higher bottoms of this up move have found supports at 100-DMA (Rs 485) and the recent one being at 50-DMA (Rs 542).While the upside momentum stays intact, the stock has found resistance at the previous top near Rs 674. The lower levels near Rs 600-mark may offer attractive entry opportunities with a target of Rs 690 and stop-loss of Rs 550.Adani Green EnergyThe recent Hindenburg report on the Adani group has played havoc on the charts; the kind of steep decline that followed makes it mandatory to consider a technical perspective with a longer-term horizon. The reaction to the Hindenburg report saw Adani Green Energy breaking down from a descending triangle.The price targets were exceeded with the stock finally tried to find a base near Rs 440 levels which also happen to be pattern support as well.Investors must hold on to this stock if purchased near recent lows with a price target of Rs 880-900 levels over a medium-term horizon while maintaining a stop-loss below Rs 439.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

JLR would benefit from easing chip supplies driving scale, ramp-up of higher-margin products, and working capital reversal with rising scale,"" brokerage firm Ambit Capital wrote in its report.Farm, SUV boost for M&MMahindra & Mahindra posted a price drop of 2.68 percent but the number of ""buy"" calls rose to 24 from 23. The foreign brokerage firm CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets upgraded M&M to ""buy"" and raised its target price by 2.2 percent.According to CLSA, strong momentum across the farm and auto business, with expectations for sports utility vehicle (SUV) volumes to expand more than 20 percent in FY24 due to a strong order backlog, constituted reasons for the upgrade.Among contrarian downgrades over February, Tech Mahindra gained around 9 percent even as investors lapped up the stock on dips after the sharp sell-off last year. This happened even as analysts chose to maintain a cautious stance with Hold ratings moving higher to 15 from 11 as Buy calls slipped to 21 from 25. Additionally, Tech Mahindra was the only stock to garner contrarian calls over a quarter.PhillipCapital continues to foresee underperformance from Tech Mahindra, compared to its peers, on growth due to a weaker portfolio. The broking firm also remains wary of Tech Mahindra's aggressive M&A strategy.Also Read: Analyst Call Tracker: Once a market darling, why investors turned lukewarm on Asian Paints""Decision-making is slow and spending is getting impacted due to the macro environment.

Pessimism for the stock seems to be emerging on account of concerns over price erosion in the US market.Nuvama Insitutional Equities, which has a ""hold"" rating on the stock believes its acquisition of Mayne Pharma’s US retail generics portfolio for $90 million, despite being a low-risk foray, adds limited value for the drugmaker.Nuvama also noted that ex-Revlimid, US growth for Dr Reddy's will face execution challenges in the face of price erosion and competition in existing molecules.Quarterly changesThe highlight among contrarian calls over the quarter were heavyweights like Reliance Industries, Hindustan Unilever, Bajaj Finserv, State Bank of India and Titan Co. In terms of contrarian downgrades, there was no significant divergence between price action and analyst action.Financials suffered the wrath of FII selling through the quarter, causing a decrease in price action. However, analysts struck positivity for the sector on the back of improving credit growth, strong fundamentals and the government's push towards capital expenditure.For HUL, a surprise increase in royalty and an uptick in ad spends turned overhangs for the stock, resulting in an 8.60 percent decline. But most brokerages argue that the management's commentary on the demand front seems to be getting more constructive over the past couple of quarters, especially in terms of rural demand that is seen improving from the lows of June-July.Systematix Institutional Equities has a ""buy"" rating for the consumer goods bellwether, with a target price of Rs 2,950.""Our view is based on expectations of above-industry growth, continued premiumisation and strategic initiatives by HUL. Despite the increase in royalty which could be a near-term overhang, we find HUL a better bet than multiple mid-cap FMCG peers to play the impending rural recovery and a pick-up in consumer goods consumption across categories,"" the brokerage noted.A similar trend was seen in heavyweight Reliance Industries as upgrades for the stock rose 5.93 percent despite a 14 percent decline in price action. Weak market sentiment, selling by FIIs and a muted earnings report by the core oil-to-chemicals business were dampeners for the stock's price action.Global research and broking firm Jefferies maintains a bullish stance on RIL and believes that the government's approval for the Green Hydrogen Mission should aid the company's green energy business.Jefferies also valued RIL's green hydrogen business at $8 billion and believes any meaningful capital subsidy from the government would support the valuation of its green hydrogen foray.Titan Co is the next stock in the list of contrarian upgrades over the quarter, with its price falling 9 percent, but Buy ratings edging higher to 27 from 25. The company had been posting robust results for the past few quarters, but lost sheen in the October-December period on account of higher gold prices, weaker wedding demand, and stronger competitive intensity.JM Financial Institutional Securities, which has upgraded the stock to ""buy"", believes Titan's 16-17 percent drop from its recent peak provides a very palatable entry valuation that is lower compared to the average stock price over the past five years.Also Read: Analyst Call Tracker: Why do analysts favour Titan even as investors lose interest in the stock?The brokerage firm is also bullish on Titan's growth prospects.

Bajaj Finance and Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone were other stocks that shared the spotlight.In the aftermath of the Hindenburg report, shares of Adani Ports witnessed a steep correction as investors exited the scrip. However, cheaper valuations, coupled with a strong growth outlook for India's biggest port operator, fuelled optimism among analysts.Also Read: Analyst Call Tracker: Why three auto stocks are winning over analysts amid price volatility?Investors also kept away from Bajaj Finance on the back of its expensive valuations. But analysts continue to maintain an optimistic stance on the company’s digital transformation and consistent financial performance. The stock shed 11.47 percent last year, but Buy calls rose to 25 from 20.Expensive valuations also dented JSW Steel as downgrades for the stock jumped 40.63 percent over the year, while price was up 7.63 percent. The company's higher debt also made analysts on the street wary of its upside potential.Also Read: Analyst Call Tracker: Why Dr Reddy's acquisition of Maynes Pharma failed to cheer analysts?Topping the list though was Coal India. ""Buy"" calls for the stock fell to 15 from 22, even as the price jumped 25.80 percent.

"  March 13, 2023 / 01:11 PM IST  ",Brokerages fret over lower tenure extension for IndusInd Bank CEO,"Sumant Kathpalia’s reappointment as IndusInd Bank managing director and chief executive officer for two more years, instead of three as was ratified by the bank's board, has left foreign brokerages a bit puzzled.Since his appointment in 2020, Kathpalia has been instrumental in spearheading the bank’s growth with marked improvement in key financial and business performance metrics. The bank’s board had in September 2022 approved the re-appointment of Kathpalia with effect from March 24, 2023 up to March 23, 2026. After six months, the RBI’s nod has come for only two years, contrary to Street expectations.Follow our live blog for all the market actionFollowing this, JPMorgan has downgraded the stock to a 'neutral' rating and cut its target to Rs 1,060 per share. “In the current environment of tightening liquidity, the reappointment for only two years could place the bank at a disadvantage,” the broking firm said.At 1 pm, the stock was quoting at Rs 1073 on the NSE, lower by 6.2 percent from the previous close. It was the top loser on the index today.Morgan Stanley, on its part, has given IndusInd Bank an 'overweight' rating and set a target of Rs 1,525 per share. Morgan Stanley analysts find it tough to ascertain the reason behind the lower tenure extension, as there have been instances of both lower as well as higher extension.Citi, on the other hand, has maintained its 'buy' rating with a target of Rs 1,420 per share. “We will closely monitor the bank's progress on its strategic initiatives towards delivering over 5 percent pre-provision operating profit and towards delivering over 2 percent RoA and over 17 percent RoE over FY24/25,” it said.According to Jefferies, the lower extension may mean slight pullback on growth and defer re-rating. It has trimmed loan growth estimate by 100 basis points for FY24-25.“The lower tenure extension may be a reflection on the need to improve on controls (MFI incidence), liabilities (retail mix), and underwriting (retail and less risky). We see this as reasonable time to demonstrate progress as the bank had already made moves on these counts,” it noted in a report.Since valuation is attractive at 1.4x FY24 price-to-book ratio, it has a 'buy' rating on the stock with target price lowered to Rs 1,550 from Rs 1,600.​Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

"  March 13, 2023 / 11:33 AM IST  ",Trading in times of correction: Top 10 ideas from experts for next 3-4 weeks,"A spate of corrections sweeping through global markets after worries intensified in the US banking space weighed on the Indian equity markets on March 10, driving the Nifty50 down 1 percent on Friday as well as in the entire last week.The index managed to defend not only 17,300 but also the 17,400 levels, and closed at 17,413 on Friday, the lowest closing level since March 2. There was formation of a bearish candlestick pattern which somewhat resembles a bearish engulfing pattern on the weekly timeframe, indicating the possibility of weakness going ahead, though there was a hammer kind of pattern formation on the daily scale on Friday, which is generally a bullish reversal pattern.The 17,300 level is expected to act as a crucial support, followed by the recent swing low of 17,250 and if the said levels get broken, then there could be correction up to the 17,000 mark, whereas on the higher side, 17,600-17,700 could be critical hurdles for further up-move towards the psychological 18,000 mark, experts said.""Friday's low around 17,320 would be seen as an immediate support followed by sacrosanct support at February's swing low of 17,250. On the flip side, the bearish gap left around 17,570–17,600 should be considered an immediate hurdle,"" Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One, said.Instead of swaying on both sides of the trend, he advised that traders should ideally prefer staying light on positions and keep accumulating quality propositions in a staggered manner.The weak global cues and underperforming heavyweights, especially Reliance Industries, were major culprits in dragging the markets down. Going ahead, it would be crucial to keep a close tab on them as any positive development globally can elevate the overall sentiment, Sameet Chavan said.Ajit Mishra, VP - Technical Research at Religare Broking said that while most of the sectors are trading in line with the benchmark, the performance of banking and financials would continue to play a key role in deciding the next directional move. Stay focused on stock selection and risk management, he advised.Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the March 10 closing prices:Expert: Viraj Vyas, Technical & Derivatives Analyst - Institutional Equity at Ashika Stock BrokingLinde India: Buy | LTP: Rs 4,015 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,800 | Target: Rs 4,450 | Return: 11 percentThe stock has been forming an ascending triangle pattern since April last year and broke out with volumes in the last few sessions. Post the strong breakout, the stock opened gap up and despite ongoing volatility, the stock continues to sustain higher which indicates buyer Strength.Post such an extended consolidation breakout, the stock appears to have a price objective of atleast of 1,000 rupees rally from the breakout level which provides a favourable risk-reward opportunity.GAIL India: Buy | LTP: Rs 111 | Stop-Loss: Rs 103 | Target: Rs 125 | Return: 13 percentThe oil and gas space is a sector which has been in a broader consolidation since almost 2 years with bouts of strengths and weakness.Looking at weekly chart, the stock has closed at the higher threshold of the consolidation of almost 2 years. The breakout was assisted with strong volumes and such breakout after elongated consolidation usually results in sharp up move.NCC: Buy | LTP: Rs 99 | Stop-Loss: Rs 90 | Target: Rs 120 | Return: 21 percentThe weekly chart of the strong depicts a Cup and Handle pattern formed over a period of around 4 years which depicts massive accumulation.The stock has also closed above the previous swing high (Rs 95-level) which indicates seller exhaustion.

During the pullback trend, the stock managed to surpass its previous peak, however, the key oscillators failed to gain momentum. Such a type of formation invites correction.The strategy should be to sell at the current level of Rs 4,750 and the rest at Rs 4,900. For that put the stop-loss at Rs 5,000. On the downside, the stock may slide towards Rs 4,500 & Rs 4,400 levels.ICICI Bank: Sell | LTP: Rs 843 | Stop-Loss: Rs 855 | Target: Rs 800 | Return: percentThe stock is forming an ascending triangle, which is a bullish consolidation for the stock, however, it has broken its support due to sudden weakness in the market. It is suggesting a correction in the near term.In such cases most of the time the stock falls to the starting point of the formation which is at Rs 800. The stock may fall down 5 percent from the current levels, which is a decent downside. Sell is recommended at current levels and above Rs 850. For this, keep the stop-loss at Rs 855.Tata Steel: Buy | LTP: Rs 108 | Stop-Loss: Rs 100 | Target: Rs 125 | Return: 16 percentIt is making a higher bottom at Rs 103.50 as compared to Rs 100, which was its previous low. The entire basket of steel stocks reversed sharply in the past week.In fact, for the past two weeks, the stock has been facing buying pressure whenever it has declined. It is relatively outperforming other sectors and also stocks from the metal baskets.A buy is recommended at current levels and at Rs 104. For that, keep a stop-loss at Rs 100. On the upside, it has the potential to move higher towards Rs 115 or Rs 125 in the medium term.Expert: Nagaraj Shetti, Technical & Derivative Analyst at HDFC SecuritiesRBL Bank March Future: Sell | LTP: Rs 155.10 | Stop-Loss: Rs 165 | Target: Rs 143 | Return: 8 percentAfter witnessing a sharp weakness in January month, the stock price has shifted into a broader high low range movement within Rs 170-150 levels. Presently, the stock price is placed at the edge of breaking below the crucial lower support at Rs 150 levels-weekly 20-period EMA (exponential moving average).The overall chart pattern indicates a formation of important top at Rs 189 in January month and there is a higher chance of further weakness emerging in coming week.Volume has started to expand during downside breakout in the stock price and weekly 14 period RSI (relative strength index) shows negative indication. Hence, one may expect further strengthening of downside momentum in the stock price ahead.One may look to create short position in RBL Bank March Future at CMP (Rs 155.10), add more on rise up to Rs 161, wait for the downside target of Rs 143 in the next 2 weeks. Place a stop-loss of Rs 165.Oracle Financial Services Software: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,242 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,025 | Target: Rs 3,480 | Return: 7 percentThe attached weekly timeframe chart of the IT stock - Oracle Financial Services Software (OFSS) indicates a sustainable upside bounce in the last few weeks.We observe a formation broader triangle pattern (converging up and down trend lines), which is unfolding over the last few months.The stock price is now in an attempt of upside breakout of the triangle at Rs 3,230-3,250 levels. Hence, a sustainable move above this hurdle is expected to bring strong upside momentum for the stock price ahead.The negative chart pattern like lower tops and bottoms (during November 21 to October 22) seems to have been completed as per weekly chart and the stock price has started to move up as per the positive pattern like higher tops and bottoms recently. This is positive indication.One may look to buy OFSS at CMP (Rs 3,245), add more on dips down to Rs 3,120 and wait for the upside target of Rs 3,480 in the next 3-5 weeks. Place a stop-loss of Rs 3,025.Expert: Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.comHindustan Petroleum Corporation: Buy | LTP: Rs 230 | Stop-Loss: Rs 222 | Target: Rs 244 | Return: 6 percentThe stock witnessed a buying interest in the week gone by and showed a relative outperformance in last couple of sessions inspite of selling pressure seen in the broader markets.The RSI oscillator has given a positive crossover indicating a positive momentum while the prices have also surpassed its ’20 DEMA’ hurdle.We expect the momentum to continue in the near term and hence, traders can buy the stock in the range of Rs 227-230 for potential short term targets of Rs 238 and Rs 244. The stop-loss on long positions should be placed below Rs 222.Polycab India: Sell | LTP: Rs 2,947 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,050 | Target: Rs 2,840 | Return: Rs 4 percentThe stock has seen a decent upmove in last couple of months and the momentum readings were in the overbought zone.

The company had been posting robust results for the past few quarters, but lost sheen in the October-December period on account of higher gold prices, weaker wedding demand, and stronger competitive intensity.JM Financial Institutional Securities, which has upgraded the stock to ""buy"", believes Titan's 16-17 percent drop from its recent peak provides a very palatable entry valuation that is lower compared to the average stock price over the past five years.Also Read: Analyst Call Tracker: Why do analysts favour Titan even as investors lose interest in the stock?The brokerage firm is also bullish on Titan's growth prospects.

Bajaj Finance and Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone were other stocks that shared the spotlight.In the aftermath of the Hindenburg report, shares of Adani Ports witnessed a steep correction as investors exited the scrip.

But analysts continue to maintain an optimistic stance on the company’s digital transformation and consistent financial performance.
