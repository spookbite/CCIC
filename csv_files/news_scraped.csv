The RBI has remained prudent as it evaluates the comprehensive effect of rate hikes that we saw over the last year,” said Divam Sharma, founder of Green Portfolio PMS.Food inflation is a matter of grave concern for the RBI and it is willing to bend over backwards to slow inflation and get it back to the tolerance band, he said.The RBI raised its growth forecast to 6.5 percent from 6.4 percent earlier, while the inflation forecast for the current financial year was lowered to 5.2 percent from 5.3 percent earlier, assuming an annual average crude oil price (Indian basket) of $85 per barrel and a normal monsoon.But it feels the lag in the passthrough of input costs could keep core inflation elevated. Inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index was 6.44 percent in February compared with 6.52 percent in the previous month.Anil Rego, founder of Right Horizons PMS, said the unchanged stance signals that the RBI is confident of its projections and expects inflation to cool gradually.Hence, Divam said there will be some respite for large debt companies, growth stocks, small and mid-cap space companies, and specific sectors like consumer durables and real estate in the medium term, thanks to the RBI’s decision to not hike rates.The benchmark stock indices extended their upward journey for the fifth consecutive session amid volatility, with the BSE Sensex rising almost 52 points to 59,741 levels and the Nifty 50 climbing 19 points to 17,576 levels, at 14:01 hours IST.Here is a list of rate-sensitive stocks that experts said can return up to 15 percent in the short term.

Usually, this is a reversal pattern (bullish in this context). The RSI (relative strength index) has given a positive divergence, as highlighted in the chart.Although there is no strength now, the stock presents a low-risk-high-reward probability. After crossing Rs 1,730, some bullishness can push the stock towards Rs 1,900.ICICI Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 885 | Stop-Loss: Rs 840 | Target: Rs 980 | Return: 11 percentThe stock has endured a corrective leg from November 2022 and although it broke away from the falling trendline, the stock has not witnessed any follow-through beyond the Rs 880-875 zone.Also read: MPC keeps repo rate unchanged, raises GDP growth forecast: 10 key takeawaysThe stock is consolidating in a narrow range of Rs 815-875 and a sustained breakout above Rs 880 is likely to inspire a move towards Rs 940-920.Recent volume activity too shows stronger buyer interest near the breakout, making a high probability bullish setup provided it sustains above Rs 840-850.AU Small Finance Bank: Sell | LTP: Rs 558 | Stop-Loss: Rs 585 | Target: Rs 540 | Return: 3 percentThe stock has broadly consolidated time- and price-wise since August 2021 and until recently, started forming lower highs and lower lows, breaking below the trendline around the Rs 600 mark.The stock since then has headed towards Rs 585 and beyond, which shows bearish intent. On the RSI indicator, the stock is at 36, which denotes that it has been forming more lower lows and is in a bearish grip.Expert: Jatin Gohil, Technical and Derivative Research Analyst at Reliance SecuritiesICICI Lombard General Insurance: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,093 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,049 | Target: Rs 1,178 | Return: 8 percentIn mid-March, the stock registered a new 52-week low of Rs 1,049 and moved sideways thereafter. A bullish divergence in short-term indicators signals that the stock may bounce back, utilising the prior consolidation.On the higher side, the stock may face a hurdle at around its prior point of polarity (Rs 1,116). As per the current set-up, the stock may surpass that hurdle easily and could move towards its 200-day SMA (simple moving average) of Rs 1,178.In case of a decline, the stock will find support around its 52-week low.Muthoot Finance: Buy | LTP: Rs 990 | Stop Loss: Rs 940 | Target: Rs 1,100 | Return: 11 percentAfter a falling channel breakout, the stock retested its extended upper band and resumed the up-move. Continuing its prior daily rising trend, the stock rose to a one-and-half-month closing high on April 5.Key technical indicators are in favour of the bulls in the medium term as well as the short-term timeframe charts.The stock has the potential to move towards its 200-day SMA of Rs 1,039 initially and the psychological level of Rs 1,100 subsequently.On the lower side, the stock may respect the extended upper band of the channel.PFC: Buy | LTP: Rs 157 | Stop Loss: Rs 149 | Target: Rs 172 | Return: 10 percentIn the last week, the stock respected its upward sloping 20-week EMA (exponential moving average) and breached its prior falling trend. Later, the stock extended gains and rose to a 12-day closing high.The positive momentum may continue, which could lead the stock towards its long-term hurdle zone of Rs 168-172.

In this process, the stock recently witnessed a potential breakout from the Master Candle Pattern, with the price moving above the 20-week EMA after a good amount of time, highlighting a bullish momentum.Also, the price decline was arrested at around its previous resistance level, which denotes polarity into play and highlights a robust price structure. Momentum indicator RSI has surpassed 50 levels with a bullish crossover, validating the bullish bias in the price.Thes stock has the potential to scale higher towards Rs 930, followed by Rs 955, with a protective stop-loss of Rs 854.Aditya Birla Capital: Buy | LTP: Rs 155 | Stop-Loss: Rs 146 | Target: Rs 173 | Return: 12 percentThe pattern analysis on the weekly charts exhibits a stage-2 breakout, followed by a potential base in the making. It witnessed a shakeout during the base formation and continued to hover above the breakout zone, which evinces another modest accumulation at elevated levels.The accumulation base forming a potential Darvas box is captivating, while it trades a hair's breadth away from the ceiling near Rs 162.45.It also shows a strong relative performance compared to the head index, which showcases further strength in the price action. We anticipate a potential upside till Rs 173 against a stop-loss of Rs 146.Bajaj Finance: Sell | LTP: Rs 5,761 | Stop-Loss: Rs 6,000 | Target: Rs 4,920 | Return: 15 percentThe stock has been under pressure for many weeks, and the price has tumbled more than 25 percent since its September 2022 highs. On the price pattern front, the stock has registered a breakdown from a contracting triangle pattern, which denotes that the dominance of bears is likely to persist.The stock has been trading below all key daily moving averages (20, 50, 100, 200), which indicates a bearish trend and lack of strength. For the past couple of weeks, the price has been consolidating at a 38.2 percent retracement level (Rs 5,650) from its prior advance from Rs 1,783 to Rs 8,050.We sense another round of selloff once the price decisively trades below Rs 5,650. Going ahead, if the price trades below the mentioned levels, it will open the way for Rs 5,335 and Rs 4,920, with a stop-loss of Rs 6,000.Expert: Rupak De, Senior Technical analyst at LKP SecuritiesHDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,654 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,615 | Target: Rs 1,725-1,776 | Return: 7 percentThe stock has given a swing high breakout on the daily chart, suggesting a rise in bullish bets.

"  April 06, 2023 / 10:25 AM IST  ",Jefferies maintains buy rating on L&T; increases target price by 22%,"Jefferies India has affirmed a ""buy"" rating on Larsen & Toubro Ltd, a leading engineering company in India. The investment bank has raised its target price for the company by 22 percent from the current market price, to Rs 2,650. This upgrade in target price reflects expectations of improved earnings, driven by a robust order book.L&T's order flow for the fourth quarter of FY23 is expected to be Rs 675 billion, which represents a YoY decline of 9 percent. Despite this, the company experienced a robust 30 percent YoY growth in the first nine months of FY23 and is likely to comfortably achieve its FY23 guidance of 12-15 percent YoY growth. To meet its target, L&T needs to make announcements worth Rs 98 billion, if 50 percent of its orders remain unannounced, Jefferies said in its latest report.Also read: DMart revenue from operations up 20% YoY, 18 more stores added in Q4So far this quarter, orders announced have been primarily in Power Transmission & Distribution (23  percent) and Minerals & Metals (16 percent), while Buildings and Water accounted for the rest. In its Q3 call, L&T's management noted an uptick in private sector capital expenditure, with increased momentum in areas such as Buildings and Factories and Ferrous Metals.This trend is also being reflected in the order flow. According to Jefferies, there are two areas with potential for positive surprises in the next 12 months: Power Transmission & Distribution and Railways. Renewable energy generation and railway capital expenditure are likely to pick up, which bodes well for L&T's prospects in these segments.During the December quarter, the company's net profit surged 24 percent to Rs 2,553 crore, while revenue increased by 17 percent to Rs 46,390 crore. International revenues accounted for 37 percent of the total revenue, amounting to Rs 17,317 crore. The EBITDA margin for the period was 7 percent, slightly lower than the 7.1 percent recorded in the corresponding quarter of the previous year.With higher commodity prices now easing off and revenue growth anticipated, there is growing confidence that margins have bottomed out. L&T is focused on maintaining a healthy balance between its balance sheet and execution, with buoyant collections being a positive sign, the Jefferies report said. In its Q3 call, L&T improved its working capital guidance to 19-20 percent of sales from the earlier range of 20-22 percent, and it remains confident of achieving this target despite increased execution levels.""We maintain our Buy rating, with a PT of Rs 2,650, valuing core E&C at 14x Sept. 24E EV/EBITDA (consol PB of 3.7x and 25.7x PE Sept. 24E). For FY22-25E, we expect core E&C EBITDA to rise at a 22 percent CAGR vs 16 percent in FY15-19 when it traded at 12x EV/EBITDA,"" Jefferies said in its report.In the bull case scenario, the brokerage firm expects an upside of 38 percent to Rs 3,000 a share from the current market price. Jefferies said the early recovery in the macro investment cycle is expected to lead to a significant increase in the company's order flow and valuations. Although there may be a contraction in margins in the Middle East region, this may not come through if there is a better margin order flow.",Larsen & Toubro Ltd.
"  April 06, 2023 / 06:45 AM IST  ","Hot Stocks | KEI Industries, Varun Beverages, Larsen & Toubro may fetch 13% return in short term","Vidnyan Sawant, AVP - Technical Research at GEPL CapitalOn the monthly timeframe of Nifty Index, after experiencing three consecutive months of negative returns, the previous month has formed a Doji candlestick pattern. This suggests a sense of indecisiveness in the market following a four-month downtrend. The recent low of 16,828.35 in the Nifty aligns closely with the lows observed in September and October 2022, thereby making it a significant level of support to monitor going forward.On the weekly timeframe, the Nifty has exhibited a notable price action development after a span of 17 weeks. Specifically, the index has closed above the prior week's high, forming a higher high and higher low pattern. This upward momentum was observed after a bounce from the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level, which was calculated based on the prior advance from 15,183.40 in June 2022 to the high of 18,887.60 in December 2022.On the daily time frame a classical breakout of the double bottom pattern can be witnessed around the same levels mentioned above. The breakout is confirmed as it is accompanied by a Gap. The 20-day SMA (simple moving average 17,216) have also been surpassed which acted as a variable resistance to the prices.The index has a strong support at 17,312 (weekly low) followed by 17,100 (key support). While on the higher side the mark of 17,650 (key resistance) followed by 17,800 (swing high) are crucial levels to watch out for.It is possible that if the index were to exceed 17,650, it could experience a positive upward momentum and potentially reach levels as high as 17,800. Conversely, if the index were to fall below 17,312, it may lose strength and experience a downward trend, potentially even falling as low as 17,100.Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks:KEI Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,744.35 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,680 | Target: Rs 1,960 | Return: 12 percentThe ratio charts of KEI against benchmark index Nifty show a rising trend, indicating strong outperformance of the stock. The recent breakout of the Rectangle pattern confirms continuation of the prior uptrend.The prices have sustained well above the 18 & 50-day EMA (exponential moving average), indicating the presence of an uptrend.On both the weekly and daily timeframes, the stock price is above the 50 mark, indicating positive momentum.Moving forward, we anticipate the stock price to rise to the level of Rs 1,960, with a recommended stop-loss of Rs 1,680 on a closing basis.Larsen & Toubro: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,257.75 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,140 | Target: Rs 2,500 | Return: 11 percentL&T has demonstrated a notable uptrend. Despite experiencing a correction from mid-December 2022, the prices did not break supports and underwent a polarity change around Rs 2,080 level. This observation underscores the resilient nature of the stock's price movement during the correction phase.The stock has recently shown a breakout of the Symmetrical Triangle pattern which indicates continuation of prior uptrend.The prices have sustained well above its key moving averages of 50, 100 & 200-day EMA which confirms the presence of prior uptrend.Additionally, the RSI (relative strength index) on the daily timeframe has shown a breakout too which reflect presence of strong momentum.Going ahead we expect the prices to move higher till the level of Rs 2,500 where the stop-loss must be Rs 2,140 on the closing basis.Varun Beverages: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,454 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,390 | Target: Rs 1,650 | Return: 13 percentThe stock price of VBL is currently trading near its life-high which tells that the stock already is in strong momentum. The recent breakout of the Rounding Bottom pattern confirms continuation of the prior uptrend.On the daily timeframe, the stock has been consistently trading near the upper Bollinger Band, indicating increased volatility. Additionally, the RSI on the Daily timeframe has shown a breakout too which reflect presence of strong momentum.In conclusion, based on these technical indicators, it is anticipated that the stock will continue to rise towards Rs 1,650 level with a suggested stop-loss at Rs 1,390 on a closing basis.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol are their own and not those of the website or its management.
