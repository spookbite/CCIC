"  April 13, 2023 / 06:38 PM IST  ",Buy Tata Consultancy Services; target of Rs 3860: Motilal Oswal,"Motilal Oswal's research report on Tata Consultancy ServicesTCS reported revenue of USD7.20b in 4QFY23, up ~0.6% QoQ in constant currency (CC) terms and 30bp below our estimates. Revenue growth was affected by a slowdown in the BFSI vertical in the second half of the quarter. TCS indicated a demand slowdown in key verticals, primarily in discretionary spends, while cost efficiency spends remained robust. Q4 deal TCV was strong at USD10.0b (up 28% QoQ, book-to-bill ratio at 1.4x), bringing FY23 TCV to USD34.1b (flat YoY) despite a muted macro environment. Q4 EBIT margin was flat at 24.5% (v/s our est. of 30bp QoQ increase), impacted by a pause in few discretionary projects in Mar’23, along with higher onsite employee costs, partially compensated by lower subcontractor expenses.OutlookWe have largely maintained our FY24/FY25 EPS estimates. Over FY23-25, we expect a USD revenue CAGR of 10.7% and an INR EPS CAGR of 15.7%. Our TP of INR3,860 implies 25x FY25E EPS (19% upside). We reiterate our BUY rating on the stock.For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

"  April 13, 2023 / 06:22 PM IST  ",Buy Tata Consultancy Services; target of Rs 3650: Sharekhan,"Sharekhan's research report on Tata Consultancy ServicesTCS reported a revenue growth of 0.6% q-o-q and 10.7% y-o-y in CC terms missing our estimates of 1.1% q-o-q CC growth in a seasonally weak quarter primarily due to weakness in North America. EBIT margin at 24.5% remained flat missing estimates on muted revenue and higher onsite costs offsetting the effect of currency tailwinds during the quarter. The company reported robust deal TCV wins with order book TCV of $10 billion versus $7.8 billion in Q3FY23 and a book to bill ratio of 1.4x recording all-time high number of large deals. The management expressed that they are seeing weakness not only in BFSI but also across other sectors in North America. Despite the strong deal wins and robust deal pipeline, which offers decent revenue visibility the management highlighted that they are being watchful over the next quarter on account of near term uncertaintes due to recent macro developments.OutlookWe believe near-term outperformance would be restricted for TCS owing to uncertain earnings outlook, CEO transition and global macro headwinds. Thus, we advise investors to adopt a staggered buying approach for long-term investment. We maintain our Buy rating on TCS with an unchanged PT of Rs. 3,650.For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

"  April 13, 2023 / 02:26 PM IST  ","CEO transitions in large, listed firms have least impact on stock prices, finds Jefferies India","A Jefferies India study covered 72 CEO transitions in large, listed companies over the past five years and found that 53 percent of these had no effect on the stock price trends. The study, instead, showed that external hires tended to have a positive impact on stock prices.Jefferies predicts that several major corporations, including Kotak Bank, SBI, HUL, TCS, ICICI Pru, Tech Mahindra, HDFC, and others will replace their CEOs within the next year, representing approximately $465 billion in market capitalisation, accounting for 21 percent of Nifty's weight and 17 percent of total FII holdings.Read: India VIX at 20-month low, indicates bullish outlook; experts warn against complacenceJefferies noted that CEO changes in companies like HUL, TCS, TechM, and ICICI Pru during the Covid period have brought attention to the impact of leadership changes on stock performance. As the macro and geopolitical situations change, businesses are likely to see more CEO transitions, such as in companies like Kotak and SBI.Some companies, like RIL, are also implementing generational changes in leadership alongside formal CEO changes.The analysis considered the 'zero date' to be one month before the actual announcement of the CEO change, as the market typically anticipates such changes. The study excluded transitions where promoters are actively managing the company and those in most PSUs where such changes are government-directed and routine.The analysis found that CEO transitions had a generally even impact on stocks, with 53 percent having no effect on the relative performance of the stock. In cases where there was a change in relative performance (47 percent of transitions), 68 percent of the changes were positive, indicating that underperforming stocks became outperformers in six months, split equally between internal and external replacements.Read: MC 30 | Why five schemes go out of Moneycontrol list of top mutual funds?Smaller-cap companies tended to hire externally for CEO replacements, with 55 percent opting for this route, while less than 40 percent of large-cap companies went for external hires. CEO changes had a significant impact on the Staples sector and the non-bank financial sector but had minimal impact on the consumer discretionary sector.Jefferies excluded other factors that could influence stock performance over longer terms from its analysis.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol are their own and not those of the website or its management.
