"  January 21, 2023 / 03:57 PM IST  ",Buy Larsen and Toubro Technology Services; target of Rs 3940: Motilal Oswal,"Motilal Oswal's research report on Larsen and Toubro Technology ServicesL&T Technology (LTTS) posted a flat QoQ topline growth in constant currency (CC) in 3QFY23, missing our estimates of ~2% QoQ growth. This was led by seasonality and higher-than-expected furloughs, especially in Plant Engineering (-4.1% QoQ), Telecom & Hi-Tech (-2.8% QoQ) and Medical devices (-1.1%), while Transportation (+4.4% QoQ) and Industrial Products (+1.1% QoQ) offset the drag. Despite weak growth, EBIT margin improved 60bp QoQ over a low base (wage hike in 2QFY23), beating our estimates of 18.3%. While we were disappointed by the weak topline growth, healthy deal wins (five deals of USD10m+ TCV, total TCV at USD100m+) suggest limited impact on deal momentum due to macro slowdown. However, the weak performance in 3QFY23 led the company to revise its guidance to 15.0% YoY in CC from 15.5- 16.5% YoY given in 2Q. The management indicated some weakness in the Telecom and Medical devices verticals, where the macro impact is the most pronounced and should continue in the near term, while traction in other verticals should aid LTTS deliver a good exit to FY23 (MOFSLe at 3.1% QoQ CC).OutlookWe continue to view LTTS as a beneficiary of the growing penetration of ER&D Services. We cut our FY23-25 EPS estimates by 1-3%. We retain our BUY rating and value LTTS at INR3,940 (premised on 30x FY24E EPS).For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

"  January 21, 2023 / 03:55 PM IST  ",Neutral Persistent Systems; target of Rs 4360: Motilal Oswal,"Motilal Oswal's research report on Persistent SystemsPersistent Systems (PSYS) reported a 3.5% growth in constant currency (CC) terms in 3QFY23. In USD terms, revenue grew 3.4% QoQ led by strong growth in IP business (+8.6% QoQ) while growth in services was lower at 3.0% QoQ. EBITDA margin was strong and stood at 18.5% (est. 17.9%). Employee addition was modest (+122 QoQ), while attrition moderated 210bp to 21.6%. The company’s performance in Services (+3% QoQ) moderated due to furloughs and ramp-down by a top client. PSYS expects a revival in top client growth over the next few quarters, which together with record TCV (USD 440m, book-to-bill ratio of 1.7x) should aid topline growth amid a weakening macro environment. Its ability to win new deals is encouraging and should help deliver another year of industry leading growth.OutlookPSYS is trading at a rich valuation of 28x FY24E P/E and on the higher side of the Midcap IT median valuation. It adequately factors in favorable growth and demand environment. Hence, we maintain our Neutral rating with a TP of INR4,360 as we see limited upside from current levels.For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.
