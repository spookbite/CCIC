"  February 08, 2023 / 02:50 PM IST  ","Reliance, BPCL among buyers using UAE currency for Russian oil","Reliance Industries Ltd., Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd. and Nayara Energy Ltd. are among Indian refiners using United Arab Emirates dirham to pay for some shipments of Russian crude as they navigate Western sanctions.Buyers have shifted some transactions to the currency, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. Payments vary from cargo to cargo, depending in part on the demands of specific traders, said the people, who requested anonymity as the details are private.Reliance, BPCL and Nayara didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.The European Union’s recent ban on imports of refined oil products from Russia has positioned India as an increasingly important customer for the shipments. Russia has been India’s top crude supplier since June as cargoes previously bound for Europe have been diverted to Asia — often sold at well below the $60-a-barrel cap.The UAE dirham provides both Indian buyers and Russian sellers with a relatively predictable currency — pegged to the dollar — without the greenback’s potential sanctions complications. Even on deals that don’t directly violate US and EU restrictions, some intermediary banks often take additional steps to avoid any risks to other banking relationships abroad.India is the UAE’s second-largest trade partner and officials are working on a mechanism to boost trade in dirhams and rupees.Most oil deals are still being transacted in dollars. India’s oil minister said he was unaware of the use of dirham in oil purchases.“If you are asking me officially am I in the know of these payment channels, no, I’m not,” Hardeep Singh Puri said in a Monday interview in Bengaluru. Officials are open to holding discussion with other countries on the issue, he said. “If the need arises, we will need to talk.”India is probably willing to accommodate requests from Russia to offer payment in dirham, considering the bargain prices offered on crude, according to Vandana Hari, founder of Vanda Insights.Still, a move away from the US dollar could risk drawing the ire of some officials in Washington. Last week, the US Treasury Department’s top sanctions official Brian Nelson traveled to Abu Dhabi, voicing concerns about the UAE’s close financial ties to Russia.",Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd.

"  February 08, 2023 / 01:33 PM IST  ",RBI raises repo by 25 bps: Check buy & sell ideas for 10 rate-sensitive stocks,"The Monetary Policy Committee of the Reserve Bank of India on February 8 raised the repo rate by 25 bps to 6.5 percent with a 4:2 majority.India's headline inflation, excluding vegetables, has been rising well above the upper tolerance band and may remain elevated, especially with high core inflation pressures, though the consumer price inflation eased for the third straight month in December.The rate hike decision was as per the most of expectations by market participants. The January CPI inflation is scheduled to be announced on February 14.According to the MPC, inflation remains a major risk to the outlook. Hence, the rate-setting panel is of the view that further calibrated monetary policy action is warranted to keep inflation expectations anchored, break core inflation persistence and thereby strengthen medium-term growth prospects.And, it decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth.""Resilient high-frequency indicators and continued rate hikes by global central banks could have spurred the MPC action even as headline inflation has shown some signs of moderation. Rate hike of 25bps seems justified on the back of high persistent sticky core inflation - above 6 percent - to keep the inflation expectations anchored,"" Dhiraj Relli, MD and CEO at HDFC Securities, said.The monetary policy acts with lags, it may take three-four quarters for the policy rate to be transmitted to the real economy, and the peak effect may take as long as five-six quarters, Relli feels.After frontloaded rate hikes since May 2022, he said there could be a strong case now to put a brake on monetary tightening. Further rate hikes beyond 6.5 percent could pose an unwarranted risk to economic growth unless inflationary pressures re-emerge, he feels.The market has reacted positively to the policy statement, with the BSE Sensex rising 376 points to 60,662, and the Nifty50 jumping 133 points to 17,854, at 1:02pm.The Reserve Bank of India lowered its CPI inflation forecast for FY23 to 6.5 percent from 6.7 percent and sees 5.3 percent for FY24.On the growth front, real GDP growth is estimated by the RBI at 6.4 percent for FY24 and the same has been raised to 7 percent for FY23 from 6.8 percent earlier, making India one of fastest growing economies.""The risk of over-tightening always exists, however, we believe growth over inflation will take the centre stage for the RBI as the world passes through a sluggish growth phase, while the US and Europe continue with measured quantitative tightening,"" of Kunal Valia, Chief Investment Officer - Listed Investments at Waterfield Advisors, said.The rate hike is going to add to the cost of capital and loans are going to become dearer, he feels.Follow LIVE updates of the RBI MPC monetary policy announcement hereWe have collated a list of rate-sensitive stocks that experts say can give healthy return over the next three-six months.

In Q3 Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals (CROMPTON)’s Butterfly business (up 1% YoY) was impacted, mainly due to muted growth in mixer grinders category (contributes 28-29% sales) and increased GST rate from 5% to 18% in wet grinder (11-12% sales). Crompton lagged in pushing non-rated fans inventory to the channel, which thereby impacted sales.

"  February 08, 2023 / 07:16 AM IST  ","This investment advisor feels, cautiously optimistic stance across sectors looks like the most prudent outlook after Q3","""Banks are at the peak of their health in terms of asset quality and in a tight monetary environment continue to flourish. Credit expansion theme seems to be continuing and the earnings have been spectacular,"" Sonam Srivastava, Founder at Wright Research told Moneycontrol in an interview.The quantitative investment management & trading professional with more than nine years of experience likes the private banking space right now lead by ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank as the budget favours credit expansion in the economy while not offering any capitalization to PSU banks.After Q3 earnings season, Sonam says the management commentary is the key in this earnings season as the numbers are hovering around the expectations.A cautiously optimistic stance across sectors looks like the most prudent outlook now, she says. Edited excerpts:Adani Group stocks have been witnessing huge volatility for over a couple of weeks after the Hindenburg report. Do you expect more correction in stock prices or is there any value buying now?It is really tough to speculate on the prices of the Adani group stocks. The corporate governance against them are quite serious and are still not flouted completely, and history has shown that stocks suffering from corporate governance issues can get into trouble.On the other hand if the short seller's allegations stay unproven the stocks might inch up. The situation is incredible in magnitude of the allegations, price movements and consequences and I don't think many including me would be able to speculate here. I would suggest people stay away from these counters by the virtue to extreme risk though.Do you really feel Budget 2023 was the greatest budget ever from the government? Also, were there any disappointments?This was a much appreciated budget for sure. The FM reinforced the India growth story and our commitment to continue on the growth path. The big announcements were a 33 percent increase in Capex, which was beyond estimates and was welcomed as the much required driver to make India the manufacturing and services hub for the world and to booth internal consumption and job creation.What was also quite a relief was that the government did not turn full welfare mode before the elections and instead kept the focus on fiscal prudence.The implications of the tax regime changes are also being widely debated as they might not have a large impact on the middle-class tax payer in the long run.Do you think the market is less bothered about FOMC outcomes now and focussing on slowdown?The FOMC stance has not turned dovish but the market for sure is discounting it. If you look at the price action in US stocks and bonds you can see that the market is in fact pricing in a rate cut at this point in time.FOMC chairman said that the deflationary forces have come into effect and this cheered the market into thinking that they might avoid recession and actually see the soft landing. But the tightened monetary is here to stay atleast through 2023 and the delayed effect of the rate hikes might also start propping up soon. The market is concerned about the slowdown and rightly so.Which are 2 best themes, you think that the Union Budget has given?The most significant announcement in the budget was an increase in total capital investment outlay by 33 percent to Rs 10 lakh crore, making effective capex Rs 13.7 lakh crore, forming 4.5 percent of GDP. This is far above our expectations of 3.5 percent and should boost the infrastructure, capital foods, cement, logistics and railways. This is a clear indication for the emergence of the theme of domestic cyclical recovery and boost for the infrastructure linked sectors.The second strong theme is the persistence by the government to prop up the new industries in India. The government has vowed to increase the ease of doing business and to clean up compliances. They have incentivized the emerging sectors in India like mobile phone manufacturing, white goods, speciality chemicals and metals. This would make India a beneficiary of the China+1 incentive.What is your call on quarterly as well as nine-month earnings announced so far?The IT sector has not performed well, but there is optimism in the market for industries such as cement, capital goods, and railways. IT, and pharmaceuticals sectors are seeing a resurgence of sentiment as well. The financial sector will continue to post the best numbers but the outlook has become more cautious, because of profit booking as well as the fear of exposure to Adani debt turning bad. Margins are seen to expand during the quarter, but the demand growth is subdued. We are seeing the consumption sector do well with discretionary sector taking a bigger lead and rural demand continuing to struggle.Any thoughts on the management commentaries and their outlook for next quarter and next financial year?The management commentary is the key in this earnings season as the numbers are hovering around the expectations. The IT sector commentary has been mixed with some optimism, decision-making delay among foreign clients has been highlighted. Financial sectors and banks continue to project earnings momentum growing.Consumption sector has also maintained a cautiously optimistic stand with a focus on expanding margins and being agile.Sectors like metals, chemicals, cement are seeing a contraction of earnings but with rising global demand continue to be optimistic. A cautiously optimistic stance across sectors looks like the most prudent outlook now.Are you worried about banks now given the recent fall or is it a great opportunity to pick quality names? Any names on your radar?Banks are at the peak of their health in terms of asset quality and in a tight monetary environment continue to flourish. Credit expansion theme seems to be continuing and the earnings have been spectacular.SBI beat all estimates to post 68 percent earnings growth. However there is a sense of caution for the banks as investors worry about the Adani debt exposure on their books.I like the private banking space right now lead by ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank as the budget favours credit expansion in the economy while not offering any capitalization to PSU banks.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

"  February 08, 2023 / 01:33 PM IST  ",RBI raises repo by 25 bps: Check buy & sell ideas for 10 rate-sensitive stocks,"The Monetary Policy Committee of the Reserve Bank of India on February 8 raised the repo rate by 25 bps to 6.5 percent with a 4:2 majority.India's headline inflation, excluding vegetables, has been rising well above the upper tolerance band and may remain elevated, especially with high core inflation pressures, though the consumer price inflation eased for the third straight month in December.The rate hike decision was as per the most of expectations by market participants. The January CPI inflation is scheduled to be announced on February 14.According to the MPC, inflation remains a major risk to the outlook. Hence, the rate-setting panel is of the view that further calibrated monetary policy action is warranted to keep inflation expectations anchored, break core inflation persistence and thereby strengthen medium-term growth prospects.And, it decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth.""Resilient high-frequency indicators and continued rate hikes by global central banks could have spurred the MPC action even as headline inflation has shown some signs of moderation. Rate hike of 25bps seems justified on the back of high persistent sticky core inflation - above 6 percent - to keep the inflation expectations anchored,"" Dhiraj Relli, MD and CEO at HDFC Securities, said.The monetary policy acts with lags, it may take three-four quarters for the policy rate to be transmitted to the real economy, and the peak effect may take as long as five-six quarters, Relli feels.After frontloaded rate hikes since May 2022, he said there could be a strong case now to put a brake on monetary tightening. Further rate hikes beyond 6.5 percent could pose an unwarranted risk to economic growth unless inflationary pressures re-emerge, he feels.The market has reacted positively to the policy statement, with the BSE Sensex rising 376 points to 60,662, and the Nifty50 jumping 133 points to 17,854, at 1:02pm.The Reserve Bank of India lowered its CPI inflation forecast for FY23 to 6.5 percent from 6.7 percent and sees 5.3 percent for FY24.On the growth front, real GDP growth is estimated by the RBI at 6.4 percent for FY24 and the same has been raised to 7 percent for FY23 from 6.8 percent earlier, making India one of fastest growing economies.""The risk of over-tightening always exists, however, we believe growth over inflation will take the centre stage for the RBI as the world passes through a sluggish growth phase, while the US and Europe continue with measured quantitative tightening,"" of Kunal Valia, Chief Investment Officer - Listed Investments at Waterfield Advisors, said.The rate hike is going to add to the cost of capital and loans are going to become dearer, he feels.Follow LIVE updates of the RBI MPC monetary policy announcement hereWe have collated a list of rate-sensitive stocks that experts say can give healthy return over the next three-six months.
