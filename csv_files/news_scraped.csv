"  July 17, 2023 / 12:43 PM IST  ",Hold Avenue Supermarts; target of Rs 3700: ICICI Securities,"ICICI Securities research report on Avenue Supermarts1QFY24 result was below consensus expectations, which was not a surprise. Revenue growth of 18% YoY (vs 12% retail area expansion) is un-exciting. Under recovery in general merchandise and apparel (still below pre-pandemic levels) continues to be a drag on gross margins (decline of 125 bps YoY). The stress in Apparel segment (~12% overall revenue share – per our estimate) is not a surprise for us (see report link 1, 2). Interestingly, the retail area of the newly added stores (3 stores added) has been conservatively reduced by ~19% of system average to 33,000 sq. ft. We believe, this is prudent given lower than expected business economics of the large size stores that were added over last 4-5 years. Now ~60% of DMART’s total retail area represent large size stores (45-50k sqft stores vs 30- 35k sq. ft. pre-COVID). Also to re-highlight the point on DMART turning conservative in the offline business: during FY23 it has added ~58% stores only in the top-3 states (vs 42% during FY18-22). That said, we reckon DMart is a platform business and the downside of this underperformance (in apparels) is limited while all other strengths of the company remain intact.

The bottomline too missed the CNBC-TV18 estimate of Rs 761.4 crore.In addition, net interest income fell around 1 percent on-year to Rs 2,490.8 crore from Rs 2,514.4 crore in the year-ago period. It also lagged CNBC-TV18's estimate of Rs 2,572.9 crore.On top of it, the bank's asset quality also deteriorated in the quarter under review as gross non-performing assets (NPAs) rose to 6.76 percent as against 4.87 percent in the preceding quarter. Net NPAs also increased to 2.18 percent from 1.17 percent seen in the previous quarter.At 9.18am, the shares of Bandhan Bank were trading with a cut of 2.14 percent at Rs 216.85 on the National Stock Exchange.Follow our live blog for all the market actionGoing by the weaker-than-expected quarterly performance from the lender, brokerages also expressed some concerns over Bandhan Bank's asset quality.Brokerage firm Nuvama Institutional Equities reckons that the lender's asset quality is still not fully stabilised as against a markedimprovement for peers, due to its continued high forward flow and evolving ECLGS (Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme) disclosures. Likewise, the firm has a 'hold' call for the stock, with a price target of Rs 242.Motilal Oswal Financial Services also remains watchful of the lender's asset quality and the high SMA (Special Mention Accounts) book despite expectations of recoveries from CGFMU (Credit Guarantee Fund for Micro Units) and ECLGS in FY24. Hence, the brokerage also cut its estimates for net profit/PPoP (Pre-provision operating profit) for FY24/FY25 by 5 percent/3 percent. MOFSL also reiterated its 'neutral' stance on the stock with a target price of Rs 240.Nomura also slashed its price target for the stock by 17 percent to Rs 270, though it retained its 'buy' rating for Bandhan Bank. The global research and broking firm however, also cut its FY24-26 EPS estimates by 11-14 percent to bake in the weak quarterly numbers.Even though Jefferies expects the loan and NII growth to improve from Q2 as disbursements pick-up and base goes down, it cut its price target for the stock to Rs 280. It also believes that slippages in Q1 included one-time additions due to a change in norms but feels the lender's coverage remain sufficient.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

At 10.30 am, shares of HDFC Bank were trading 0.44 percent down at Rs 1,638 on BSE.India’s biggest private sector lender is expected to report a robust 26-percent growth in net profit for the first quarter of this fiscal amid stable asset quality, though margins may see some pressure, analysts said.HDFC Bank – which has completed its merger with HDFC with effect from July 1 – is likely to report a net profit of Rs 11,584 crore, representing a 26-percent jump YoY, as per the average of a poll of estimates of four brokerages.The bank had posted a standalone net profit of Rs 9,196 crore in Q1 FY23.However, when compared sequentially, net profit is seen declining from Rs 12,047.45 crore in Q4 FY23.Also Read: HDFC Bank Q1 net profit expected to soar 26% YoY; margins in focusMeanwhile, shares of HDFC Bank issued in lieu of HDFC shares got listed on the exchanges.The lender has allotted 3,11,03,96,492 new equity shares of Re 1 each, according to the share exchange ratio of 42 shares of HDFC Bank for every 25 shares of HDFC Ltd, it said in a regulatory filing post market hours on July 14.The bank's paid-up share capital will increase from Rs 559.17 crore to Rs 753.75 crore post cancellation of promoter holding of 116.46 crore equity shares.HDFC Bank is a now a fully publicly held company following the merger, with no promoter.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

"  July 17, 2023 / 09:57 AM IST  ",HDFC Bank Q1 Preview: Net profit expected to soar 26% YoY; margins in focus,"India’s biggest private sector lender HDFC Bank is expected to report a robust 26 percent growth in net profit for the first quarter of this fiscal amid stable asset quality, though margins may see some pressure, analysts said.HDFC Bank – which has completed its merger with HDFC with effect from July 1 – is likely to report a net profit of Rs 11,584 crore, representing a 26 percent jump YoY, as per the average of a poll of estimates of four brokerages.The bank had posted a standalone net profit of Rs 9,196 crore in Q1 FY23.However, when compared sequentially, net profit is seen declining from Rs 12,047.45 crore in Q4 FY23.Follow our live blog for all the market actionAnalysts expect its net interest income (NII) — the difference between interest earned and interest paid — to climb 21 per cent to Rs 23,553 crore, as against Rs 19,481 crore in the year-ago period.However, the net interest margins (NIMs) – a key measure of profitability – can slip up to 10 bps from 4.1 percent in Q1 FY23.This is because domestic banks’ funding costs are elevated while lending yields may not have material repricing benefits, analysts said.Q1 Update“The Indian banking sector continued to see y-o-y credit growth momentum at mid-teens through 1Q FY24, which should translate into high-teens credit growth for most large banks, especially in sticky loan segments like retail and SME. However, the fact that a highly motivated HDFC Bank could deliver only 10.7 percent CASA growth y-o-y suggests to us that system CASA growth still remains weak,” BNP Paribas analyst Santanu Chakrabarti said in a note.HDFC Bank had disappointed the Street earlier this month with a lacklustre Q1 business update.Its advances aggregated to approximately Rs 16.15 lakh crore for the quarter ended June 30, up nearly 15.8 percent year on year (YoY) from Rs 13.95 lakh crore a year ago. The bank's advances grew around 0.9 percent on quarter over quarter (QoQ) basis against Rs 16 lakh crore in Q4FY23.Deposits jumped 19.2 percent YoY for the said quarter to Rs 19.13 lakh crore, from Rs 16.04 lakh crore in Q1FY23. They were up 1.6 percent QoQ from Rs 18.83 lakh crore in the quarter ended March 31, 2023.Also Read: With Rs 14.7-lakh-cr MCap, HDFC-HDFC Bank united to outgrow top 4 private, 13 PSU lendersCASA (current accounts and savings accounts) deposits -- a cheap source of funds which helps boost banks’ NIMs – aggregated to Rs 8.13 lakh crore, growing 10 percent on-year but down 2.7 percent over Rs 8.36 lakh crore at March end.Results MatrixHDFC Bank’s earnings expectations have already been rebased after the release of the business update, Nuvama Research said.“The bank has posted a disappointing business update with deposit growth of 1.6% QoQ and loan growth of 0.9% QoQ versus expectations of 4% QoQ. Even on a consolidated basis, loan growth of 15% YoY and 0.7% QoQ is lower than the guidance of 18% YoY. Standalone NIM will likely remain stable QoQ. Slippage will rise QoQ due to seasonally high agri slippage,” it added.Concerns on the agri front have been voiced by other experts as well.“Asset quality is expected to see a slight blip and slippage ratio could rise from 1.26% to 1.46%, driven by agri slippages especially in case of SBI and HDFC Bank,” Prabhudas Lilladher said, adding Q1 usually sees agri delinquencies.As per Emkay Research, slower business growth, moderating NIMs and slightly higher opex and provisions can keep Q1 profit growth in check for HDFC Bank.The domestic brokerage sees slippages inching up QoQ due to seasonally high NPAs from the agri portfolio.“The banking sector has bounced back over the past three months (Nifty Banking index up 10%) due to its inherent resiliency amid bank failures somewhere else, healthy credit growth belying expectations of a slowdown and a stabilizing policy/interest rate environment,” it said.Though the sharp margin improvement story is largely behind, earnings momentum is expected to remain strong in Q1 and, thus should support the current banking rally with PSBs and small-midcap banks benefiting more.“Notwithstanding near-term business dislocation due to the merger, we believe HDFC Bank should be back in the game from H2,” it added.Analysts expect the lender’s asset quality to be steady. HDFC Bank had reported gross NPAs at 1.12 percent in the previous quarter, with net NPAs at 0.27 percent.This is in line with the improving asset quality of the overall Indian banking system over the past few years.As per RBI data, Indian banks’ gross NPA ratio declined to 3.9 percent in March 2023 – a 10-year low. The net NPA ratio of the scheduled commercial banks also improved to 1.0 percent, a level last observed in June 2011.HDFC Bank's total Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) as per Basel Ill guidelines was at 19.3 percent as on March 31, 2023, as against a regulatory requirement of 11.7 percent.Provisions and contingencies for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 were Rs 2,685.4 crore.Merged Entity Q1 UpdateSome key takeaways about HDFC Bank and HDFC’s merged balance sheet:-Gross advances were up 13.1 YoY and 0.7 percent QoQ basis, reaching Rs 22.45 lakh crore.- Deposits aggregated to approximately Rs 20.63 lakh crore in Q1FY24, up 16.2 percent YoY and 1.2 percent QoQ.- The merged entity's average liquidity coverage ratio for the Q1 stood at around 120 percent on a proforma basis.Shares of HDFC Bank are up 1 percent on YTD basis, though the 1-year return stands at 21 percent.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

"  July 17, 2023 / 08:11 AM IST  ",Makes sense to buy IT now; Eicher oversold: Religare’s Siddharth Bhamre on his picks,"The market is no longer cheap at these levels but there are pockets of opportunity nevertheless, says Siddharth Bhamre, Research Head, Religare Broking. “I won’t say we are very expensive right now, but we are headed into that zone,” Bhamre said in a free-wheeling chat with Moneycontrol.He is bullish on the information technology (IT) sector, which is not finding too many takers right now because of the cautious view on the United States economy. And the latest quarterly numbers seem to bear that out. HCL Tech’s and Wipro’s June quarter earnings were short of market expectations and while TCS numbers just about met analyst estimates, there were signs of growth slowing down.“The concerns over earnings growth are valid but that also needs to be seen in the context of valuations,” Bhamre said.Also Read | HCLTech Q1 Results: Net profit rises 8% YoY to Rs 3,534 crore; revenue up 12%“The talk of the US slipping into recession has been on for more than a year now, and a large part of that fear is already reflecting in the prices. At one point, investors were willing to pay 35 times (one-year forward earning), now they balk at paying anything over 20,” he said, pointing out that IT stocks have been underperforming since tumbling from their record highs in January 2022.“And if you listen to the management commentary, you will note that the deferments are mostly for smaller, short-term projects, not the long-term ones which help (US) companies cut on costs. So yes, the situation is not as dire as most people would like to believe. You are never going to get attractive valuations and good earnings visibility at the same time. But if you are a value investor, it makes sense to start accumulating IT shares at these levels. It won’t be a smooth ride, there will be a lot of noise along way as the market reacts to the news flow from the US economy,” Bhamre said.Religare’s top picks in the IT sector are HCL Tech, Infosys and TCS. It is cautious on Wipro.AutoIn the auto sector, Maruti, Eicher Motors and Bajaj Auto are Bhamre’s preferred picks.“I feel pessimism over Eicher Motors may have been overdone,” he says. The Eicher Motors stock has taken a beating over the last couple of weeks following the launch of superbikes by Hero Motor Corp and Bajaj Auto in partnership with Harley Davidson and Triumph, respectively.Also Read | TCS Q1 Results: Net profit up 16.8% at Rs 11,074 crore, revenue at Rs 59,381 crore“There will be a dent in Eicher’s market share no doubt, but I don’t think it will be as significant as the market is expecting. The new players have yet to show that they can scale up quickly. Also, competition is nothing new to Eicher; when Java was launched three years ago many had said that (Royal) Enfield’s domination will be under threat. Things did not quite play out that way. Also, Harley’s and Triumph’s launches are not a bolt out of the blue; the market had priced it to some extent. That could explain why the stock has been struggling since peaking around Rs 3,850 in October last year. I am not saying that Harley and Triumph are not formidable competitors, but often the market gets ahead of itself.""Lastly, Eicher is not a pure-play premium bike story; the commercial vehicle story also looks quite strong. Maybe the dynamics of the premium bike segment will change radically over the next five years, but that is still some way off,” he said.As for Maruti, Bhamre is betting on the company gaining a respectable share in the SUV segment where it has launched new models recently. “For a long time, Maruti was about volume growth. That story is changing. Maruti’s earnings growth will now be driven by better margins as it sells more of its high models. The stock has underperformed for a long time, and despite the recent run up, valuations are not pricey,” he said.CementReligare’s top bets in the cement sector are Ultratech, Dalmia Bharat, Ramco and Nuvoco Vistas.“The valuations right now are not exactly cheap, but cement is a good long- term story,” Bhamre says. The two key triggers according to him — government spending on infrastructure and the boom in the real estate market.“Till some months back, cement was a story about price hikes. That (price hikes) has stopped happening. But the pressure on margins is expected to ease going forward as raw material prices have cooled. There is a lot of capacity coming on stream right now, so cement prices may not go up much. But even so, cement is more a story about volume growth than price hike,” he says.FMCGBhamre feels the recovery in the rural economy will be a major driver of FMCG stocks in the coming days. “The latest employment data shows that things are turning around in the rural markets,” he said.According to Bhamre, FMCG stocks are not cheap at current levels in terms of absolute PE (price-to-earnings) multiples. “They (FMCG) have always been expensive, sometimes less so, sometimes more, there is no denying that. Having seen some of the stocks trade at multiples of 60 and 70 at one point, 50 may not look too bad.""My point is that key FMCG stocks still look okay when compared to the historical 10-year average PE one-year forward. That’s not such a bad deal. Besides, when there is talk of a recession in the US which could hurt the Indian market as well, it makes sense to have defensive stocks in the portfolio,” Bhamre says. His picks in the FMCG space are HUL, Colgate and Marico.“We are not so bullish on ITC, which at 35 plus times one year forward is above its historical average. It is a good story no doubt, but the risk-reward ratio does not look very appealing at this point,” he says.Banks“Banks are one of the safest stories right now. You just need to have them in your portfolio. You can’t go much wrong there. The retail loan book is not growing much, but given the strength of the corporate balance sheets, the risk of NPAs are the lowest in a very long time,” Bhamre says.“Retail loan book still has plenty of scope for growth. Household debt is at manageable levels. And while incomes have not been rising fast, aspirations surely are. Also, the commodity cycle is down right now, but the companies will start borrowing to expand capacity for the next upcycle,” he says.",Hero MotoCorp Ltd.

"  July 17, 2023 / 06:49 AM IST  ","MC Interview | These two largecaps can see a swift rally in rest of July, says Milan Vaishnav of Gemstone Equity Research","After finally closing above 19,500, ""there are greater chances that the Nifty may certainly test 19,800-19,900 levels if we take some cues from the Options data,"" Milan Vaishnav, CMT, MSTA, founder and technical analyst at Gemstone Equity Research says in an interview to Moneycontrol.As the Nifty IT index had seen a huge buying on last Friday, he believes it is certainly a great time to start accumulating IT stocks.Milan with nearly two decades of experience in the equity markets, expects the banking space to play catchup. ""ICICI Bank is set to witness a breakout; I would focus on ICICI Bank as one of the stocks that can see a swift rally if it is able to keep its head above Rs 960-970 levels,"" he said.Q: Is it the right time to buy RBL Bank that has been on buyers' radar since April?Although RBL Bank has been on the buyer's radar since April, the first entry point came on June 30 when the stock staged a breakout when it crossed Rs 180-182 levels.Currently, the stock remains in a strong uptrend. There is a room on the upside and the stock has the potential to test Rs 265-270 levels over the coming months. Some consolidation cannot be ruled out; one can accumulate the stock between Rs 198-210 levels if it sees some consolidation.Q: Will it be an easy ride for the Nifty50 to climb above 20,000 mark in current quarter?With the kind of trending moves it saw in the previous trading session, Nifty has certainly opened up some more room for itself on the upside. The levels of 20,000 are definitely psychologically important levels from one perspective. There are greater chances that the Nifty may certainly test 19,800-19,900 levels if we take some cues from the Options data.Also read: Netweb Technologies IPO opens | 10 key things to read before applying for offerSo far as testing 20,000 levels in this quarter is concerned, it would be premature to put expectations without any rationale. In fact, two things can happen; the Index can go near 20,000 and also face strong resistance there.Q: Do you expect Nifty Pharma to surpass its record high levels in coming months?This can be answered from a different perspective. The Nifty Pharma Index witnessed a breakout when it crossed above 13,000 levels.Presently it is some 5 percent away from its high point; however, it remains overbought and may see some consolidation. That being said, the Pharma space is set to relatively outperform the broader markets and this may definitely see Nifty Pharma to surpass its record high levels over the coming months.Q: Two stocks which can see swift rally in rest of July?I expect the banking space to play catchup. ICICI Bank is set to witness a breakout; I would focus on ICICI Bank as one of the stocks that can see a swift rally if it is able to keep its head above Rs 960-970 levels.Also read: India set to dominate emerging markets as breakout star of the decade: Capital Group reportAnother stock that I see is from a largecap IT services space. LTIMindtree is set to stage a breakout; any sustenance above Rs 5,100 can see the stock meaningfully higher than its current levels.Q: Are you a big fan of real estate sector?You can call me a big fan of anything that portrays strong Relative Strength. The Realty sector index has been inside the leading quadrant of the RRG (Relative Rotation Graph) for many weeks now; this is the reason that we are witnessing a strong relative performance of the realty space against the broader markets.This is likely to continue; however, we cannot also rule out this space taking a breather and consolidating. The testing of 550-565 levels by the Realty Index would lead to testing of a major double top and some consolidation at those levels cannot be ruled out.Q: Given the strong run up in Nifty IT on Friday, is it really a great time to start picking stocks in the sector?Yes, it is certainly a great time to start accumulating IT stocks. I will have a stock-specific approach while doing this.

And the latest quarterly numbers seem to bear that out.

Also, competition is nothing new to Eicher; when Java was launched three years ago many had said that (Royal) Enfield’s domination will be under threat. Things did not quite play out that way. Also, Harley’s and Triumph’s launches are not a bolt out of the blue; the market had priced it to some extent. That could explain why the stock has been struggling since peaking around Rs 3,850 in October last year. I am not saying that Harley and Triumph are not formidable competitors, but often the market gets ahead of itself.""Lastly, Eicher is not a pure-play premium bike story; the commercial vehicle story also looks quite strong. Maybe the dynamics of the premium bike segment will change radically over the next five years, but that is still some way off,” he said.As for Maruti, Bhamre is betting on the company gaining a respectable share in the SUV segment where it has launched new models recently. “For a long time, Maruti was about volume growth. That story is changing. Maruti’s earnings growth will now be driven by better margins as it sells more of its high models.

Having seen some of the stocks trade at multiples of 60 and 70 at one point, 50 may not look too bad.""My point is that key FMCG stocks still look okay when compared to the historical 10-year average PE one-year forward. That’s not such a bad deal. Besides, when there is talk of a recession in the US which could hurt the Indian market as well, it makes sense to have defensive stocks in the portfolio,” Bhamre says.

We expect EBIT margin to expand by 25 bps QoQ (ex-integration costs) driven by higher utilisation/ merger synergies, offsetting the impact of weak growth,” analysts at Jefferies said.The foreign brokerage expects IT players to be impacted by the continued softness in the discretionary IT spends driving project ramp-downs/deferments, longer sales cycles, and slower revenue conversion due to fewer short-term deals.Macro HeadwindsEchoing the views, Kotak Institutional Equities expects LTIMindtree to post muted revenue growth of 0.5 percent on qoq basis due to lower pass-through revenue, deal transitions and delayed start to certain engagements in BFSI.Also Read: LTIMindtree stock enters big league, its operating metrics less soHowever, it sees healthy growth in deal wins and 50 bps qoq increase in EBIT margins due to lower pass-through revenues and operational improvements.“We expect investors to focus on -- factors that underpin confidence to achieve double digit growth…, health of deal pipeline and conversion rates, state of demand in impacted verticals of BFS and hi-tech, positioning in cost take-out deals and vendor consolidation events and levers to offset high wage inflation especially onsite,” it said in a note.Meanwhile, Nuvama Institutional Equities expects LTIMindtree to log revenue growth of 0.7 percent QoQ in constant currency as growth is expected to be weak in BFSI and retail, while hi-tech is expected to rebound.“We expect margins to expand by +42bps QoQ - driven by growth and absence of any major headwind/merge related expense.

The Nifty50 closed above the 19,500 mark for the first time, especially after breaking the eight-day consolidation range of 19,300-19,500 points.The index jumped 1.2 percent to 19,565 and formed a long bullish candlestick pattern on the weekly charts, with making higher highs formation for 16th consecutive week.Further, the index has seen a breakout of upward sloping resistance trendline adjoining highs of December last year and previous week, with the momentum indicator RSI (relative strength index) showing bullish crossover on all timeframes.Technically, the Nifty seems to be looking strong now. Hence, 19,600-19,700 is expected to be key resistance area initially for the Nifty50, followed by 19,800-19,900 levels, with immediate support at 19,500, and then at 19,400-19,300 levels, experts said.""The bulls are being resilient to let loose their grip even in the overbought parameters which showcase their dominance. But at the same time, one should not become complacent and overrule the possibility of a breather post the steep rally,"" Osho Krishan, Senior Analyst for Technical and Derivative Research at Angel One, said.As far as levels are concerned, he feels 19,400-19,300 is likely to cushion any short-term blip, while the sacrosanct support lies around the bullish gap of 19,200 in the comparable period.On the flip side, as the index entered uncharted territory there is no relevant hurdle; however, the next pitstop could be seen around 19,650-19,700 on an immediate basis, he said.He expects strong moves in the broader markets amid the quarterly earnings, so one needs to have a stock-centric approach for better trading opportunities and also stay abreast with global and domestic developments.Option data clearly indicated that 20,000 can be a possibility for the Nifty in coming weeks, but in near term, 19,600-19,700 can act as a resistance area, while the 19,500-19,300 is expected to be support area.Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research) at Mehta Equities feels the bulls are likely to remain in control.

"  July 17, 2023 / 06:49 AM IST  ","MC Interview | These two largecaps can see a swift rally in rest of July, says Milan Vaishnav of Gemstone Equity Research","After finally closing above 19,500, ""there are greater chances that the Nifty may certainly test 19,800-19,900 levels if we take some cues from the Options data,"" Milan Vaishnav, CMT, MSTA, founder and technical analyst at Gemstone Equity Research says in an interview to Moneycontrol.As the Nifty IT index had seen a huge buying on last Friday, he believes it is certainly a great time to start accumulating IT stocks.Milan with nearly two decades of experience in the equity markets, expects the banking space to play catchup. ""ICICI Bank is set to witness a breakout; I would focus on ICICI Bank as one of the stocks that can see a swift rally if it is able to keep its head above Rs 960-970 levels,"" he said.Q: Is it the right time to buy RBL Bank that has been on buyers' radar since April?Although RBL Bank has been on the buyer's radar since April, the first entry point came on June 30 when the stock staged a breakout when it crossed Rs 180-182 levels.Currently, the stock remains in a strong uptrend. There is a room on the upside and the stock has the potential to test Rs 265-270 levels over the coming months. Some consolidation cannot be ruled out; one can accumulate the stock between Rs 198-210 levels if it sees some consolidation.Q: Will it be an easy ride for the Nifty50 to climb above 20,000 mark in current quarter?With the kind of trending moves it saw in the previous trading session, Nifty has certainly opened up some more room for itself on the upside. The levels of 20,000 are definitely psychologically important levels from one perspective. There are greater chances that the Nifty may certainly test 19,800-19,900 levels if we take some cues from the Options data.Also read: Netweb Technologies IPO opens | 10 key things to read before applying for offerSo far as testing 20,000 levels in this quarter is concerned, it would be premature to put expectations without any rationale. In fact, two things can happen; the Index can go near 20,000 and also face strong resistance there.Q: Do you expect Nifty Pharma to surpass its record high levels in coming months?This can be answered from a different perspective. The Nifty Pharma Index witnessed a breakout when it crossed above 13,000 levels.Presently it is some 5 percent away from its high point; however, it remains overbought and may see some consolidation. That being said, the Pharma space is set to relatively outperform the broader markets and this may definitely see Nifty Pharma to surpass its record high levels over the coming months.Q: Two stocks which can see swift rally in rest of July?I expect the banking space to play catchup. ICICI Bank is set to witness a breakout; I would focus on ICICI Bank as one of the stocks that can see a swift rally if it is able to keep its head above Rs 960-970 levels.Also read: India set to dominate emerging markets as breakout star of the decade: Capital Group reportAnother stock that I see is from a largecap IT services space. LTIMindtree is set to stage a breakout; any sustenance above Rs 5,100 can see the stock meaningfully higher than its current levels.Q: Are you a big fan of real estate sector?You can call me a big fan of anything that portrays strong Relative Strength. The Realty sector index has been inside the leading quadrant of the RRG (Relative Rotation Graph) for many weeks now; this is the reason that we are witnessing a strong relative performance of the realty space against the broader markets.This is likely to continue; however, we cannot also rule out this space taking a breather and consolidating. The testing of 550-565 levels by the Realty Index would lead to testing of a major double top and some consolidation at those levels cannot be ruled out.Q: Given the strong run up in Nifty IT on Friday, is it really a great time to start picking stocks in the sector?Yes, it is certainly a great time to start accumulating IT stocks. I will have a stock-specific approach while doing this. TCS, Tech Mahindra, Infosys, LTIMindtree, Tata Elxsi etc are some of the stocks that are on our radar.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.
