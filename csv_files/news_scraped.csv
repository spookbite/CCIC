Now the management and shareholders can focus on the growth of the Group.The dispute was over a post of directorship in Ambadi Investments Ltd (AIL), which is the holding company of the Rs 36,893-crore Murugappa Group. Arunachalam, who has been engaged in a long-standing battle for recognition as her father's heir, had reportedly proposed her name for the directorship in a notice back in 2020. The Murugappa family's patriarchal practice of allegedly keeping women out of the group's businesses has hit the headlines yet again.The members of the Murugappa family first discussed and concluded the terms of the family arrangement amongst themselves at a meeting in the presence of their respective advisors, the group said in a statement.Also read: Murugappa family settles disputes with Valli Arunachalam, withdraws legal proceedingsAlong with settling the disputes, Valli Arunachalam's legal proceedings against Murugappa Family will be withdrawn.

	Valuation at premium but best placed to ride API upcycle

While Divi’s Lab (CMP: Rs 3,655; Market cap: Rs 97,026 crore) posted a sequential drop in sales in Q1FY24, it was largely a result of the pass-through of lower raw material cost.

On the other hand, an improvement in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margin was a welcome relief....

"  August 21, 2023 / 08:27 PM IST  ","Godrej Consumer posts serious slump in Raymond portfolio sales, post integration","In a turn of things that has confounded analysts, Godrej Consumer Products posted sales equalling one-third of previous year’s sales for the June quarter in the consumer care portfolio it acquired from Raymonds. Even worse, the sales number was equal to the losses incurred by the business. The Park Avenue and Kamasutra brands posted net sales of Rs 48 crore in the April-to-June quarter, which was almost equal to the losses incurred by the business. The sales figures before integration were significantly higher than the number posted in the third quarter.In FY23, Raymond’s consumer care business recorded an annual turnover of Rs 622 crore. Dividing the topline number equally in four quarters, the quarterly number comes to Rs 155 crore. The actual net sales posted by the company for the June quarter at Rs 48 crore fell woefully short of the previous year's sales.Why were sales so low for Raymond’s consumer care business this quarter? There is one legitimate reason for that.Raymond consumer care business was integrated in Godrej Consumer Products on May 8. This left only 58 days out of the 91 days full quarter for the company to sell its products, said Kaustubh Pawaskar, Deputy Vice-President of Fundamental Research at Sharekhan. Even if the same run rate of sales were taken for 91 days, the number would come up to Rs 75 crore, significantly lower than the quarterly run rate for FY23 of Rs 155 crore.Also read How complete gets Godrej after buying out Raymond's? Whiff of scepticism in the airThe yawning gap analysts say is because of “cleaning up” of the Raymond business. Raymond’s distributors were sitting on 90 days of stock which is much higher than Godrej Consumer Products distributors who hold 10 days of stock. The company is down stocking, which leaves fewer products with the distributors, and thus reduces sales.""We down-stocked the distributors and we're going to have to cut it down further. The distributors in this business were sitting at 80-90 days of stock,"" said the Godrej Consumer Products management in its Q1FY24 earnings conference call.Another reason for lower sales in the quarter was product returns or negative sales taken by the company, the management said in the call.Godrej Consumer Products is now trying to run the business in their own way and not follow Raymond’s path. “The company is reducing distributors for its products and retaining only the champion products in the Raymond business,” said another analyst who wished not to be named.He further said that a lot of stock is lying on the racks, and Godrej Consumer Products is trying to process which products would work and which won’t. Mostly the company will streamline its manufacturing with products that are accepted well by consumers, said the analyst.Pawaskar expects the Raymond business to stabilise in the next two quarters. “Raymond business will see a flattish year-on-year revenue growth and single digit EBITDA margins in FY24,” said Pawaskar. The FY24 business will be earnings dilutive and from the next year it will be positive, he added.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

"  August 21, 2023 / 11:23 AM IST  ",D2C surge: Traditional brands pivot for next-gen wallet share,"Dabur India, a leading FMCG giant, is exploring acquisitions in the direct-to-consumer (D2C) arena, especially within the healthcare and personal care sectors, said CEO, Mohit Malhotra.In a post-earnings investors' conference call on August 3, Malhotra said that this will help Dabur grow in the high-end market and become stronger in city areas. The company said that they have money on the balance sheet for acquisition purposes. Earlier this year, Dabur bought a 51 percent stake in Badshah Masala, venturing into the branded spices and seasoning sector.Many companies like Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL), Marico, ITC, and Tata Consumer Products have been active and have bought many direct-to-customer food businesses. For instance, in January, ITC announced its acquisition of Yoga Bar, a company specializing in healthy snacks. Marico is set to acquire a 58 percent stake in Plix, a plant-based nutrition brand, for Rs 369.01 crore. Marico previously purchased 32.75 percent of Satiya Nutraceuticals Private Limited, the company behind The Plant Fix- Plix. The acquisition of the remaining 25.25 percent is expected to be finalized by May 2025.Analysts commenting on big companies acquiring D2C brands noted that when traditional brands introduce a new product, consumers automatically associate it with the brand's existing values. In contrast, D2C brands are seen as more innovative and cater to a younger audience. By acquiring a D2C brand, traditional companies can establish a unique value proposition, promoting their growth.In the D2C market, food and personal care brands are gaining the most attention. One of HUL’s top beauty brands, Lakmé, offers a smooth and engaging shopping experience through its D2C website, www.lakmeindia.com, which attracts over 25 million visitors annually. It's harder for homecare brands because customers focus more on price. While people want cheap homecare products, they're willing to try new things in food and personal care.Some companies like Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) launched their own D2C platform to serve consumers directly. The company has a diverse D2C portfolio that includes the UShop platform and 11 other dedicated brand websites, said a company spokesperson. HUL's IC Now platform allows customers to order ice creams for home delivery using local delivery apps, he added.Similarly, Nestle introduced their very first direct-to-consumer (D2C) website, www.mynestle.in, starting in Delhi NCR, with plans to spread to other areas. Additionally, the site provides gourmet recipes and complimentary nutritional advice, said a company spokesperson.D2C is also cost-efficient. For traditional channels even if the product is good, it may fail due to the cost that is inbuilt in the system. “In case of D2C, the channel itself provides some bit of branding and you get a capital avoidance over there. For D2C the performance can also be judged based on their reviews.” said Ajay Thakur, an analyst at Anand Rathi Institutional equities.Analysts said that the growth in the D2C space has moderated and has declined to 40-50 percent from a 100 percent growth. But their growth does align with the growth of other FMCG brands in the e-commerce channels. Going forward, the growth should be more or less in line with industry growth, they added.Talking about the outlook of the D2C brands, Marico spokesperson said that only businesses with strong fundamentals, concentrating on profitability per unit, high customer retention, and low cash expenditures will thrive in the long term. Others might merge or consolidate. “Key to scale up and succeed in this space is the ability to bring differentiated offerings with large addressable market base and strong omni channel capabilities.” he added.",ITC Ltd.
"  August 21, 2023 / 07:50 AM IST  ",Top 10 stock picks for next 3-4 weeks as D-Street may slow down further,"The markets had yet another disappointing week ended Friday with the benchmark indices losing six-tenth of a percent and staying in the red for the fourth week in a row. The last week's low point of 19,250, which also coincides with 50-day EMA (exponential moving average), is expected to be crucial this week as well. A breach of this level may pull down the index up to the psychological 19,000 mark, whereas on the higher side, 19,400-19,500, which have the maximum Call open interest, can be critical hurdles, experts said.The Nifty50 ended the week above 19,300 and formed a bearish candlestick pattern on the weekly charts, making lower highs for the fourth straight session, indicating the sentiment remains weak but we have not seen a severe correction yet. The index fell around 3.4 percent from its all-time high of 19,992 on July 20.""Key indices are stuck in a range and till we do not find any major trigger, the consolidation is likely to continue,"" Sameet Chavan, head research, technical and derivatives at Angel One said.For any kind of revival, he said the first sign of revival would be confirmed once the Nifty sustains above the 19,370 – 19,400 levels, which may then push Nifty towards the next cluster of 19,550 – 19,650.On the flipside, 19,250 is to be seen as a critical support; because a drift below this would result in a sharp correction towards the major support zone of 19,100 – 19,000 (which seems unlikely at this moment), said Sameet who advised traders to refrain from complacent trades and continue with one step at a time approach.Rupak De, senior technical analyst at LKP Securities also sees support at 19,250 on the lower end. ""A fall below 19,250 may trigger a correction towards 19,000 and beyond. On the higher end, resistance is at 19,500.""Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas from experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the August 18 closing prices:Expert: Viraj Vyas, CMT, technical & derivatives analyst | institutional equity at Ashika Stock BrokingMishra Dhatu Nigam: Buy | LTP: Rs 390 | Stop-Loss: Rs 365 | Target: Rs 445 | Return: 14 percentUndergoing significant time and price consolidation from 2020 until June 2023, the stock recently achieved a notable breakthrough above Rs 270 levels, thereby initiating a robust impulsive move. Demonstrating a consistent upward trajectory, the stock has consistently established higher highs and higher lows.Remarkably, even amid market turbulence last week, the stock effectively surmounted its former swing high of Rs 380, sustaining this achievement. With minor fluctuations aside, the stock is projected to maintain its current trajectory, characterized by a trend acceleration phase.Latent View Analytics: Buy | LTP: Rs 425 | Stop-Loss: Rs 400 | Target: Rs 500 | Return: 18 percentAfter experiencing a substantial corrective phase following its IPO listing in November 2021, the stock stabilized around June 2022. Over the past 13 months, the stock has been confined within a broad range of Rs 300 to Rs 400. Notably, last week saw a significant breakthrough beyond the upper boundary of this range, accompanied by robust trading volumes.Historically, extensive consolidations of this nature often prompt swift movements in the breakout direction. Anticipating this pattern, the stock is likely to establish a structure of higher highs and higher lows, indicating the potential for an imminent impulsive move.Expert: Nandish Shah, senior derivative and technical analyst at HDFC SecuritiesOrient Cement: Buy | LTP: Rs 189 | Stop-Loss: Rs 175 | Targets: Rs 204-215 | Return: 14 percentAfter running correction of last few days, the stock price resumed its uptrend on Friday with higher volumes. Stock price has broken out on the weekly chart by surpassing the previous top resistance of Rs 185.Momentum Oscillators like - RSI (relative strength index 11) and MFI (money flow index 10) are sloping upwards and placed above 60 on the weekly chart, indicating strength in the current uptrend of the stock.Indian Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 407 | Stop-Loss: Rs 385 | Targets: Rs 432-450 | Return: 11 percentThe stock price has broken out on the weekly and monthly charts on the higher side. Momentum Oscillators like - RSI (11) and MFI (10) are sloping upwards and placed above 60 on the weekly chart, indicating strength in the current uptrend of the stock.PSU banks as a sector is showing strength on the short and medium term chart.Bharat Forge: Buy | LTP: Rs 971 | Stop-Loss: Rs 920 | Targets: Rs 1,030-1,058 | Return: 9 percentOn week ended August 11, 2023, the stock price had broken out by surpassing resistance of Rs 920 odd levels to close at all time high level. Primary trend of the stock remains positive as stock price is trading above its important moving averages.Plus DI (directional indicator) is trading above minus DI while ADX (average directional index) line is placed above 25, indicating stock price is likely to gather momentum in the coming days.Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, head of equity research (retail) at Kotak SecuritiesSBI Life Insurance Company: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,282.5 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,245 | Targets: Rs 1,330-1,370 | Return: 7 percentThe stock has formed a higher bottom at Rs 1,266 compared to Rs 1,251 it formed at the beginning of the month. In the last 7 days, it has lost over 7 percent and is now trading near Rs 1,251.We believe the primary trend is positive, and based on the last three weeks, the stock may form a double bottom around Rs 1,250. Buying at current levels and placing a stop-loss at Rs 1,245 would provide a good risk-reward ratio.The stock would face hurdles near Rs 1,330 and Rs 1,370 levels on the upside, which should be the targets for positional traders.Max Financial Services: Buy | LTP: Rs 871.5 | Stop-Loss: Rs 840 | Targets: Rs 1,000-1,050 | Return: 20.5 percentThe stock is on the verge of crossing Rs 885 levels, below which the stock has spent almost 18 months. Based on the volume indicator, buyers are turning aggressive which will keep the stock above Rs 885 levels.Above Rs 885 levels, its next hurdle lies only in Rs 1,000-1,050 zone. Based on key oscillators like MACD (moving average convergence divergence) and DMI (directional movement index), we believe the stock is fully bullish and ready to move higher in the medium term.A buy is recommended with a stop-loss of Rs 840 for a target of Rs 1,000 and Rs 1,050.State Bank of India: Buy | LTP: Rs 573 | Stop-Loss: Rs 550 | Targets: Rs 600-620 | Return: 8 percentThe stock has formed a Dragonfly Doji on a weekly basis, which may be a sign of a trend inverter. However, for that the stock should cross the level of Rs 580, which is the final resistance to the stock.On the dismissal of Rs 580, the stock may hit the level of Rs 600 and Rs 620 in the coming few weeks. Since the formation is bullish, our strategy should be purchased with a stop-loss at Rs 550.Expert: Mitesh Karwa, research analyst at Bonanza PortfolioEIH: Buy | LTP: Rs 224 | Stop-Loss: Rs 203 | Target: Rs 254 | Return: 13 percentThe stock has seen breaking out of a bullish candle on the weekly timeframe after more than four years with a big bullish candlestick pattern, adding to it the stock is trading and sustaining above all its important EMAs which can be used as a confluence towards the bullish view.On the indicator front, the Ichimoku Cloud is also suggesting a bullish move as the price is trading above the conversion line, base line and cloud.Momentum oscillator RSI (14) is at around 66 on the daily time frame indicating strength by sustaining above 50.Observation of the above factors indicates that a bullish move in EIH is possible for target upto Rs 254. One can initiate a buy trade in between the range of Rs 221-223, with a stop-loss of Rs 203 on daily closing basis.Punjab Chemicals & Crop Protection: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,150.5 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,025 | Target: Rs 1,342 | Return: 17 percentPunjab Chemicals has seen breaking out of a downwards sloping parallel channel pattern with above average volumes and a big bullish candlestick on the daily timeframe.

"  August 21, 2023 / 12:42 PM IST  ","ICICI Bank, Bajaj Finance, TVS, L&T among top picks by Jefferies; Here’s why","Global brokerage firm Jefferies is bullish on names like ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, TVS Motor, Tata Motors and L&T, among others, due to factors like superior growth, demand pick up and margin recovery.Here are the top ‘buy’ recommendations by Jefferies, categorised into various sectors.FinancialsICICI Bank“ICICI Bank is among our top picks across Indian financials as we believe that the bank can sustain superior growth, better asset quality and higher ROEs,” it said in a report.The lender is well poised to leverage on growth pickup led by deeper penetration and higher market share in urban micro-markets in metro and near metro areas, it added.Target Price: Rs 1,240Axis Bank“We upgraded Axis Bank to one of our top picks, a few months back as we believe past investments has made the franchise stronger and bank is on track to deliver higher growth and RoEs on a sustainable basis,” Jefferies said.Integration with Citibank’s India retail platform is progressing well with limited attrition among staff and customers and significant scope for synergies on revenues as well as cost, it added.Target Price: Rs 1,200IndusInd Bank“We believe IndusInd Bank is on track to deliver a turnaround in ROA as it continues to improve core franchise with a focus on building domain specialisation to ramp up on liabilities (NRI, HNI, wealth) and loans (new vehicle loans, micro-banking and SME),” it said.The bank has a dominant position in segments like commercial vehicles, microfinance and diamond trade finance that form one third of overall loans. It expects 20 percent CAGR in loans over the next 3-5 years and plans to ramp up newer areas like housing, used-car, merchant financing, gold loans and business banking.Target Price: Rs 1,750Bajaj Finance“Bajaj Finance is well positioned to deliver a robust growth of 28 percent CAGR in AUM over the next 3 years as it leverages on expansion into new markets and addition of new products. It plans to enter into segments like commercial vehicles financing, car loans (used and new), micro-lending among others, to capture the gaps in the existing portfolio and support growth over the medium term,” Jeffries said.The company has built strong digital platforms over the past few years with the intention to improve engagement with existing customers. Its app has over 40 million users and is among the largest finance app downloads in the world.This can offer scope for operating efficiencies that can compensate some compression in net interest margins (NIMs) in FY24, it added.Target Price: Rs 8,830ICICI Prudential Life“We were encouraged to see pick up in premium growth as a key agenda for the new CEO and CFO of ICICI Prudential Life. Growth will be supported by an expansion in agency, measures to boost productivity, and customer-centric products,” Jefferies noted.The pain from lower sales in ICICI Bank channel should start tapering off as annualized premium equivalent (APE) of this channel was down 14 percent in June-23 as against a decline of 38 percent in FY23. In 1QFY24, contribution of the bank fell to 13 percent of APE.“We see limited downside from here and growth should start improving from 2H FY23,” it added.Target Price: Rs 700Cholamandalam Finance“We believe Chola’s AUM should grow at 26 percent CAGR over FY23-26e led by strong demand for auto loans, expansion of loan against property and affordable housing loan branches to its auto finance branches and strong growth momentum in less cyclical new businesses,” it said.Margins have bottomed and should inch up slowly due to loan mix shift. The company has seen the impact of higher rates upfront versus peers and its cost of funds largely reflects higher rates, it added.Target Price: Rs 1,350SBI Cards“We expect SBI Cards’ card spends and receivables to grow at 23 percent CAGR over FY23-26e given healthy growth in industry card spends and as SBI Cards should gain by increasing penetration within SBI’s large addressable customer base and leveraging its wide range of co-branded card tie ups,” it said.NIMs could slowly inch up over FY24-26e led by improving EMI/ revolver mix and higher yields on EMI loans, it added.Target Price: Rs 1,100AutosTata Motors“We like Tata for the strong ongoing business cycle at JLR, improving Indian commercial vehicle/passenger vehicle demand and a stronger India passenger vehicle franchise,” it said.At Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), a strong product cycle and easing chip constraints should drive strong operating and financial performance.Target Price: Rs 800TVS Motor“We believe in a strong cyclical recovery in Indian two-wheelers (2Ws) after the abnormal 35 percent fall over FY19-22 for the segment that is core to Indian personal mobility; we believe 2Ws are ripe for a replacement cycle too. We see 2Ws growing at 15 percent CAGR over FY23-26E after rising 19 percent YoY in FY23,” Jefferies said.TVS has been improving its franchise across multiple segments with attractive product propositions. TVS has risen to No. 2 position in electric two-wheelers space in recent months, and has plans to expand its EV portfolio.Capital Goods & LogisticsL&T“We expect 1H FY24E to bring order flow traction as elections drive front-loaded order flow; 2H should benefit from margin recovery as the execution of projects won in an inflated commodity price environment picks up,” Jeffries said.The brokerage firm believes the peak of non-core investments is behind and L&T has the potential to surprise on execution and order flow expectationsTarget Price: Rs 3,050Thermax“Management focus is on leveraging its brand in green offerings, improving capital allocation, margin improvement and seeking new renewable energy (RE) growth avenues with global tie-ups,” it said.Thermax’s brand is well placed for its larger agenda of being a leader for India in terms of clean water, clear air and clean energy by offering new product solutions to its existing customers, Jefferies added.Target Price: Rs 3,085Real EstateMacrotech“Macrotech (Lodha) is India's largest listed developer by land bank and the largest residential developer by pre-sales in Mumbai. The company enjoys an almost even mix of premium and affordable housing segment,” Jefferies said.It is also monetizing its large 4,000 acre+ land bank through a combination of digital infrastructure (warehousing / industrial land) and residential township development.Target Price: Rs 860Godrej Properties“GPL is among the top listed residential developer by pre-sales and the only one with a diversified presence across 4 large Tier-1 cities,” it said.The company has done well on new project adds with Rs550 billion worth of projects added since FY21. Residential prices have moved significantly since then.ConsumerGodrej Consumer Products“Godrej Consumer (GCPL) has faced several headwinds in the last two years, ranging from elevated input inflation (led by palm, crude etc.) and slowdown in volume growth, to a sharp decline in its Indonesia business,” it said.However, this is changing in the last few quarters. Volume growth in India is improving, led by category development initiatives under the new CEO. Input inflation has moderated and margins are recovering to pre-inflation levels, Jefferies added.Target Price: Rs 1,200Zomato“Within Food services, online food delivery at a 12 percent penetration is in its early days in India and can compound at a ~20 percent CAGR in the next decade. What makes the online food delivery market more attractive is the duopoly between Swiggy and Zomato,” it said.Zomato turned PAT positive in 1Q FY24, way earlier than guidance. Improving profitability across both food delivery and quick commerce should continue to drive sharp earnings growth, it added.ChemicalsNavin Flourine“Management maintains FY24 growth guidance in specialty chemicals despite demand volatility as newly commissioned capacities ramp up and expects growth to accelerate in FY25,” it said.Jefferies has forecast 26 percent PAT CAGR over FY23-26 -- the strongest in its chemical’s coverage.Target Price: Rs 5,475Pharma & HealthcareSun Pharma“Sun Pharma is the largest player in the domestic market with market share of ~8.5 percent. With a very strong product portfolio on both Acute and Chronic segment, the business should sustainably clock low double-digit growth,” Jefferies said.A ramp up in products like Cequa and Winlevi will help to grow the US business at high single to low double-digit even if sales of generic business do not increase from hereon, it added.Target Price: Rs 1,310Max Healthcare“Max Healthcare will be increasing bed capacity by 85 percent in next 4-5 years where more than 60 percent of the beds are brownfield beds which will have shorter breakeven time and higher EBITDA margins,” it said.Max Healthcare will get 400 new beds capacity in FY24 while 100 new brownfield beds came up in 4QFY23, where the breakeven was within the first month of operation.Target Price: Rs 650Medanta“Medanta's mature hospitals demonstrate a steady margin profile, while its new hospitals in Lucknow and Patna are expected to ramp-up strongly and drive overall Ebitda CAGR of 18 percent over FY23-25E,” it said.The flagship unit in Gurgaon has started new specialties and ramped up doctor hiring in high-demand areas, this will result in healthy growth numbers in this mature unit also, the report said.CementUltraTech Cement“UltraTech Cement, India’s number 1 cement producer with a pan-India footprint and Jun-23 domestic capacity at ~130 mtpa, is expanding its domestic cement capacity organically to 158 mn tonnes by FY25/FY26. Including International Operations, capacity will move from current 136 mtpa to 163 mtpa during the same period,” it said.Cement demand growth has seen a sharp uptick in the last 2 years with double-digit growth for FY23/1Q FY24 at 11 percent and 16 percent, respectively. The strong growth is driven by real estate pickup and increased infra-segment allocation by the central government.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.
