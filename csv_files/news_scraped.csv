This has been overshadowed by Hindenburg's report, which flagged concerns about debt levels and the use of tax havens.""All transactions entered into by us with entities who qualify as 'related parties' under Indian laws and accounting standards have been duly disclosed by us,"" Adani said in the 413-page response issued late on Sunday.Read More: Adani report fallout: Banking, LIC shares crack""This is rife with conflict of interest and intended only to create a false market in securities to enable Hindenburg, an admitted short seller, to book massive financial gain through wrongful means at the cost of countless investors,"" it added.Hindenburg did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Adani response on Sunday. It put out a statement on Monday, January 30, alleging that Adani was trying to side-step their questions and obfuscating with nationalism.Its report had questioned how the Adani Group has used offshore entities in tax havens such as Mauritius and the Caribbean islands, adding that certain offshore funds and shell companies ""surreptitiously"" own stock in Adani's listed firms.The research report, Adani said, made ""misleading claims around offshore entities"" without any evidence whatsoever.Read More: Adani Enterprises FPO open, should you subscribe?Adani said on Thursday that it is considering taking action against Hindenburg, which responded on the same day by saying it would welcome such a move.Hindenburg's report also said five of seven key listed Adani companies have reported current ratios, a measure of liquid assets minus near-term liabilities, of below 1 which it said suggested ""a heightened short-term liquidity risk"".It said key listed Adani companies had ""substantial debt"" which has put the entire group on a ""precarious financial footing"" and that shares in seven Adani listed companies have an 85% downside due to what it called ""sky-high valuations"".Adani's response stated that over the past decade, its group companies have ""consistently de-levered"".Defending its practice on pledging shares of its promoters - or key shareholders - the Adani Group said that raising financing against shares as collateral was common practice globally and loans are given by large institutions and banks on the back of thorough credit analysis.The group added there is a robust disclosure system in place in India and its promoter pledge positions across portfolio companies had dropped from more than 50% in March 2020 in some listed stocks, to less than 20% in December 2022.'SAIL THROUGH'The Hindenburg report, and its fallout, is seen as one of the biggest career challenges to face the billionaire, whose business interests range from ports, airports, mining and power to media and cement.Adani's response included more than 350 pages of annexes that included snippets from annual reports, public disclosures and earlier court rulings.Hindenburg, Adani said, had sought answers to 88 questions in its report, but 65 of them were related to matters that have been disclosed by Adani portfolio companies in annual reports.The rest, Adani said, relate to public shareholders and third parties, and some were ""baseless allegations based on imaginary fact patterns"".Hindenburg, known for having shorted electric truck maker Nikola Corp (NKLA.O) and Twitter, said it holds short positions in Adani companies through U.S.-traded bonds and non-Indian-traded derivative instruments.Adani also responded to allegations by Hindenburg relating to the company's auditors, saying ""all these auditors who have been engaged by us have been duly certified and qualified by the relevant statutory bodies.""Its response comes just hours ahead of India market opening, when the $2.5 billion secondary share sale begins its second day of subscription.

"  January 30, 2023 / 06:25 AM IST  ","Hot Stocks | Why should you bet on PVR, Emami, and sell Max Financial Services for short term?","It was truncated, but the week ended January 27 has been one of a rough ride for the bulls on Dalal Street. The Nifty remained in the red for the past three consecutive trading sessions and Friday came like a doomsday with the index breaking the supports at 17,775 - 17,750 and, eventually, closing with a loss of over 2 percent near 17,600.We observed a trend move on the downside during the week. The upside resistance was at 18,200 and the index turned precisely from there and now we have a confirmed breakdown below 17,775. The breakdown has a shape that resembles a bearish flag pattern and if this works then we might see the targets of 17,200 – 17,000 in the coming few weeks. The pattern will get negated only above 18,200. The view is clear that till the time 18,200 is not taken out, we are in a sell-on-rise mode.The Nifty Bank index took most of the beating since the index was down by more than 5 percent during the week and almost retested the 40,000 mark. Previously we had a view that below 41,500 the index can go down towards 40,000 but that might act as psychological support. A similar kind of movement was witnessed since the support of 40,000 is still not broken.Going ahead a breach of the same might intensify the selling pressure that the index might be heading toward 38,000 mark. On the upside; resistance is placed at 41,500 for the time being.Here two buy calls and one sell call for short term:Emami: Buy | LTP: Rs 439 | Stop-Loss: Rs 409 | Target: Rs 480 | Return: 9 percentIn spite of the fact that the said counter has witnessed massive beating after making the high of Rs 524 on September 26, 2022 which resulted in a 22 percent cut in stock price. Since last month the said counter looks like it has stabilized around Rs 410-415 zone.Following are some important points that are making Emami as a buy candidate:Bullish Bat was seen on a daily scale with a potential reversal zone of Rs 415-425. Furthermore, bullish divergence was seen on the daily scale of RSI (relative strength index) and MACD (moving average convergence divergence). In addition to bullish divergence, trendline violation was seen on RSI. (refer to the chart).Selling volume has dried up from the recent fall from Rs 480 to 410 thus indicating a possible turnaround. In the previous trading session, the counter witnessed decent buying of 4.5 percent supported by good volume at lower levels.Looks like the price structure has changed since Emami has vouched for by breaking its previous swing high of Rs 438 and successfully closing near Rs 440 mark.One can buy in the range of Rs 436-442 in a small tranche and another around Rs 420-425 (if tested again). Target is expected at Rs 480 with a stop-loss of Rs 409 on a daily closing basis.PVR: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,740 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,649 | Target: Rs 1,825 | Return: 5 percentAt the current juncture, PVR is trying to stabilize near the 0.618 retracements of its previous rally which was started from December 2021 till August 2022.Following are some important pointers that are making PVR a buy candidate:Bullish AB=CD was seen on a daily scale with a potential reversal zone of Rs 1,620-1,650. Furthermore, bullish divergence was seen on the daily scale of RSI and MACD histogram. In addition to bullish divergence, trendline violation is seen on RSI. (refer to the chart).Also, Triple bottom formation was seen on 0.618 retracement which makes PVR more lucrative at current levels.Looks like the price structure has changed since PVR has vouched for by breaking its previous resistance of Rs 1,700 and successfully closing near Rs 1,740 mark.One can buy in the range of Rs 1,725-1,740 in a small tranche and another around Rs 1,680-1,700 (if tested again). Target is expected at Rs 1,825 with a stop-loss of Rs 1,649 on a daily closing basis.Max Financial Services: Sell | LTP: Rs 838 | Target: Rs 770 | Return: 8 percentThough MFSL might look lucrative after a 33 percent up move in the current month whereas broader market almost remained negative. But one needs to be cautious and look at the bigger picture. The following pointers will throw some light on the same.On a daily scale, MFSL is in a clear downtrend., it has been making lower highs and lower lows structure for the last 16 months.Since two trading sessions, MFSL has made a Shooting Star followed by a Bearish Engulfing pattern exactly near its historical trendline which is 16-18 months old. (refer to the chart).Hidden bearish divergence was seen on the daily 14-period RSI, where price action is not able to clear out its previous historical highs but RSI is making higher highs in the extreme zone.One can book profits immediately. Fresh buy is not recommended at current levels.

In fact, it was a disheartening start to the February series on January 27 and, as a result, the market shed more than 2 percent in the passing week.The Nifty50 closed at more than four-month low of 17,604, breaking out of the strong support at 17,800 held for a month amid consolidation and posting the biggest weekly loss since the week ended December 23.The next support lies at 50 WEMA (weekly exponential moving average) of 17,400 after breaking the short-term moving averages of 9, 20 and 21 weeks. Experts hope to see a lot of volatility given the Union Budget week, but if the Nifty manages to hold the 50 WEMA, then there are fair chances that the index can easily surpass the 17,800-18,200 zone in the coming days, followed by 18,500.""From an optimist point of view, it’s good that the market is approaching this event (Budget 2023) on a lighter note and any favourable outcome would lift the markets higher.

On the other hand, Reliance was at Rs 2,700 whenever the market touched 18,500 level.After a period of 4 months, the stock has again fallen to the level of Rs 2,300. Based on the logic of the bullish parallel channel, contra traders should be buyers at current levels and more on the downside around Rs 2,250. However, it requires a final stop-loss at Rs 2,150. On the upside, Rs 2,440, Rs 2,550 and Rs 2,700 would be major barriers.Titan Company: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,331 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,150 | Target: Rs 2,600 | Return: 11 percentFrom the lows of July 2022, the stock displayed a spectacular rally.

Place a stop-loss at Rs 2,150, which is slightly below the retracement level of 61.80 percent. Hurdles would be Rs 2,500 and Rs 2,600.HDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,616 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,500 | Target: Rs 1,750 | Return: 8 percentThe stock remained well above Rs 1,600-1,550 levels in last 3 months. In fact, whenever the stock dropped to Rs 1,600 or Rs 1,550 levels, it was quickly bought up.In the last three days, Bank Nifty and bank stocks declined vertically, however, HDFC Bank remained the least loser.Technically, we should be positional buyers between Rs 1,600 and Rs 1,550. Keep stop-loss at Rs 1,500. On the upside, the stock may decline towards Rs 1,680 or Rs 1,750 levels.Expert: Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.comITC: Buy | LTP: Rs 346 | Stop-Loss: Rs 334 | Target: Rs 367 | Return: 6 percentThe stock has recently seen a corrective phase where prices have corrected from the high of Rs 361 to Rs 325.

The RSI (relative strength index) oscillator is hinting at a positive momentum and hence, we expect an upmove in the stock in the short term.Hence, short term traders can look for buying opportunities in the range of Rs 346-342. The possible near term targets for the stock are expected around Rs 358 and Rs 367. The stop-loss for long positions should be placed below Rs 334.Maruti Suzuki: Buy | LTP: Rs 8,737 | Stop-Loss: Rs 8,420 | Target: Rs 8,970 | Return: 3 percentPost a corrective phase, the auto stocks have seen a positive momentum during last week and within this sector, Maruti has witnessed a pullback move along with rise in volumes. After the recent price-wise correction, the stock witnessed some consolidation and price volumes action indicates that the stock would resume its higher degree uptrend.The RSI oscillator is in buy mode on the daily chart and is turning positive on the weekly charts as well.Hence, traders can look to buy the stock on dips in the range of Rs 8,620-8,600 for potential targets around Rs 8,820 and Rs 8,970. The stop-loss for long positions should be placed below Rs 8,420.Expert: Vidnyan Sawant, AVP - Technical Research at GEPL CapitalKEI Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,573 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,465 | Target: Rs 1,780 | Return: 13 percentThe KEI has recently shown a bounce to the upside while taking support from the Bullish trend line which the prices have respected since May 2021.Around the level of Rs 1,385 the stock has witnessed change in its polarity by the prices which points towards the rising bullish sentiment behind the intact trend.The stock's price has surpassed the 20-week EMA which acted as a variable support for the prices.While the momentum indicator RSI on the Daily timeframe has shown a Range shift which reflects the rising momentum for the prices.We expect the prices to move higher till the level of Rs 1,780 where the stop-loss must be of Rs 1,465 strictly on the closing basis.Supreme Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,539 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,330 | Target: Rs 2,900 | Return: 14 percentSupreme, is currently Trading near record Highs which tells that the stock already is in strong momentum.The stock in the first week of November 2022 gave a breakout from the Inverse Head and Shoulder pattern which indicated beginning of the trend to the upside.The bounce to the upside in the latest week is preceded by the prices taking support from the 16-week EMA, which acted as a strong variable support to the prices.The RSI on the Daily timeframe has given a breakout, which reflect strong bullish momentum.We expect the prices to move higher till the level of Rs 2,900 where the stop-loss must be of Rs 2,330 strictly on the closing basis.Tata Motors: Buy | LTP: Rs 445.60 | Stop-Loss: Rs 390 | Target: Rs 560 | Return: 26 percentThe correction in the Tata Motors post January 2022 took in a disciplined way as the stock did not get into lower low, lower high formation.The stock in the latest week gave a breakout from the Descending Triangle pattern which points towards the beginning of the trend to the upside.The breakout is confirmed as it was accompanied by higher volumes and a gap.The momentum indicator RSI has shown a bullish breakout which reflects the strong momentum in the prices.We expect the prices to move higher till the level of Rs 560 where the stop-loss must be Rs 390 on the closing basis.Expert: Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand RathiEmami: Buy | LTP: Rs 439 | Stop-Loss: Rs 409 | Target: Rs 480 | Return: 9 percentIn spite of the fact that the said counter has witnessed massive beating after making the high of Rs 524 on September 26, 2022 which resulted in a 22 percent cut in stock price.

"  January 30, 2023 / 09:54 AM IST  ","MC Interview | These 5 stocks look lucrative on higher degree charts after bloodbath, says this technical chartist","""We believe 17,470-17,420 would act as a strong support zone in the near term and if the mentioned support zone is protected we anticipate a pullback towards 17,800-18,200 on the Nifty50,"" Rohan Shah of BP Wealth says in an interview with Moneycontrol.After the recent bloodbath in the markets, the Head of Technical Research with over eight years of experience feels there are a couple of stocks that denote a solid chart structure and look lucrative on the higher degree charts, which are expected to do well in the future.""We are optimistic on Ashok Leyland, Max Healthcare, Supreme Industries, IRCON, and Apollo Tyres,"" Shah says. Excerpts from the interview:Do you expect the Nifty to break 200 DEMA (day exponential moving average) as well as 200 DMA (day moving average) in the coming days or will there be a sharp pullback, especially after the recent turmoil?Post sharp selloff last week and the breakdown below the key support level of 17,800 all eyes are now glued on 200 DEMA (of 17,550) which is designated to be the last ray of hope for the bulls. In September 2022, the index had corrected 7.5 percent from a swing high and formed a bottom near the 200 DEMA (16,750).A similar price action has been observed now; so far the index has plummeted 7.4 percent from the recent swing high (18,888) and currently, it is placed around 200 DEMA. Also, near the same juncture, the index has a support of 38.2 percent retracement level of its prior whole advance from 15,183 to 18,888 and 50 WEMA (weighted exponential moving average), which is placed around 17,470 and 17,420, respectively.Thus we believe this zone to act strong support zone in the near term and if the mentioned support zone is protected we anticipate a pullback towards 17,800-18,200.As we have seen a bloodbath on Dalal Street, which are the potential multi-baggers to buy now?Technically, there are a couple of stocks that denote a solid chart structure and look lucrative on the higher degree charts. They are expected to do well in the future and one should follow a buy-on-dips approach with a time horizon of 8-12 months.To name a few, we are optimistic on the following stocks: Ashok Leyland, Max Healthcare, Supreme Industries, IRCON, and Apollo Tyres.Do you think the Bank Nifty will hold the 40,000 mark or will it get broken decisively?Analysing the short-term and medium-term charts, we perceive the Bank Nifty has significant support a few points below 40,000, i.e. at the 39,700-38,800 zone.Around this territory, the banking index has a confluence of support which includes reciprocal AB=CD Harmonic Pattern, 200 DEMA, and a cluster of Fiboannic retracement lines. Hence if the mentioned support zone is validated, we sense an oversold bounce cannot be ruled out.India VIX moved closer to 200 DMA now. Do you expect the VIX to cross the high of September 2022?There seems to be a low probability of the VIX index surpassing the high of September 2022. From the level perspective, the VIX index has a key resistance around the 20-20.50 zone; till that is not taken out, the VIX index is expected to trade in a broad range from 12-20.What should be the best strategy to follow in such kind of environment?Staying with the leaders would be the best strategy to follow. To pick the stocks from the universe which have relatively outperformed the benchmark index, stocks that have managed to hold 20 DEMA, solid chart structure and stock prices continue to form progressive higher highs and lows. Apart from technical parameters, traders must follow their trading plan, disciplined in following stop loss and targets.As per your technical studies, which is the best trading (technical) pattern that works in such a fall as well as in an uptrend?Being an ardent follower of Harmonic Patterns, I use different Harmonic Patterns, primarily to project potential reversal zones, trend reversal, and trend continuation. Harmonic Pattern is an advanced concept in technical analysis that was introduced in 1999 by Scott Carney. These patterns are derived by applying different Fibonacci tools, ratios, and techniques.They unveil unique trading opportunities with a favourable risk-to-reward setup. Like price patterns, there are different Harmonic Patterns such as AB=CD, Gartley, BAT, Crab, Butterfly, Cypher, etc. Among other patterns, I extensively follow AB=CD Harmonic Pattern, which is easy to spot and accurate in spotting reversals and momentum.Will the Nifty Auto index hit a record high in February?The index witnessed renewed buying interest over the past few weeks after the index reversed retesting the neckline of the multi-month Cup and Handle price pattern. The momentum indicator continued to stay strong.Despite a sharp selloff in the broader market, the Auto index managed to close the last week higher by 3 percent, which clearly denotes the inherent strength. Thus, there is a high probability that the Nifty Auto index is likely to hit a record high in February.What does the February series look like?There are two major events lined up this week, India's Union Budget and US Fed's first policy meeting in 2023, which will set the tone for the markets in the near term. However, we would be closely following the levels discussed earlier and will approach the market accordingly.If the mentioned support zone in Nifty & Bank Nifty is protected there is scope for the pullback. Among the sectors, NiftyPharma, NiftyAuto, NiftyFMCG, and NiftyIT are expected to do well in the February series.Any three stock picks for short term?Berger Paints: Sell |  LTP: Rs 540 | Stop-Loss: Rs 565 | Target: Rs 470 | Return: 13 percentThe price action on Berger Paint continues to deteriorate whilst trading in stage 4 of corrective phase and is already trading below the 200 WEMA and 61.8 percent. The price action further plummeted below the crucial polarity trendline and a pivotal support in the week gone by.The relative strength and performance as compared to Nifty is trading with a negative slope over the last 7 months which is not a good sign. The RSI too is trading with a lower high and lower low sequence since it peaked in January 2021 which indicates dearth in strength of the price momentum.InterGlobe Aviation: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,094 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,000 | Target: Rs 2,265 | Return: 8 percentThe price action on the daily timeframe has staged in a Cup and Handle schematic. It is currently hovering a pivotal support Rs 2,070.The major moving averages have a positive slope which indicates bullish biasness, it is relatively outperforming the benchmark index of Nifty which dictates strength in the stock. The RSI is consolidating near the media and the MACD is trading in the positive territory.The price action has immediate support at 20 DEMA trading at 2074 levels and it is anticipated to attract further bullish momentum on sustenance above the same.Sun Pharma: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,043 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,005 | Target: Rs 1,125 | Return: 8 percentThe price action on the daily time frame is trending in the direction of its prior bullish pattern breakout of rounding bottom. It saw decent profit taking from 52-week high level and the intermediate corrective trend resulted in the formation of bullish reversal harmonic pattern of ABCD. It is now bolstered by a pivotal support.The pharma stock displays stronger relative performance as compared to the head index of Nifty the trending momentum shows strength by means of RSI scaling above 60 levels. Hence we reiterate a bullish bias in the pharma stock.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

By an agile organisation I mean, budgeting, hiring and overall management of operational metrics will be discussed every month.

Our BPO business continues to be the largest and fastest growing business, having a growth of about 21 percent in Q3. The BPO sector has had a very strong quarterly performance.”He added, “Considering that there was a soft macro environment, geopolitical winds are not settled and it is traditionally a slow quarter, I am happy with Tech Mahindra’s Q3 performance. I can attribute this to our focus in customer experience management, customer centricity and investments in 5G, and overall CME continuing to pivot the growth.”Rohit Anand, CFO, Tech Mahindra added, ""Within the Enterprise vertical some of the sub-segments driving the growth are hi-tech; and verticals around retail, transport, logistics and manufacturing have come back to growth after few quarters of tepid performance.”Gurnani believes while the demand remains strong, the decision making will be slow overall among clients, especially in the areas of discretionary spending.In a separate statement, Gurnani had called out the moderation in growth in the quarter due to tough macro-economic environment.Speaking with Moneycontrol earlier this month during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Gurnani had said that based on his client conversations and 50-odd meetings that he attended, he didn’t particularly expect the way forward to be negative thoug,h he’ll remain cautious.“In terms of how positive it would be, a lot depends on the way US Fed would react. There is always more than one layer that you need to unpeel because ultimately corporates do depend on some indications from the US.
