Revenue growth was fueled by better performance across all the verticals (especially aluminum, copper and iron ore) during the quarter. VEDL’s consolidated EBITDA was at INR95b (down 31% YoY/up 34% QoQ) in 4QFY23, in line with our estimate of INR91b. Aluminum vertical grew 93% QoQ to INR19b; HZL was up 15% QoQ to INR43b and iron ore vertical jumped ~5x QoQ to INR3.6b. All the verticals were profitable during the quarter. VEDL’s APAT stood at INR32b (down 50% YoY/up 106% QoQ) against our estimate of INR37b. The miss was led by higher finance cost and depreciation, partially offset by higher other income and lower taxes. LME prices across the non-ferrous portfolio improved QoQ. Zinc/Lead/ Copper/Aluminum prices were up 4%/2%/12%/3% on a QoQ basis. The company’s sales volumes across the sector improved QoQ (except the oil & gas vertical). Sales for steel/aluminum/zinc/iron ore rose 30%/2%/5%/ 21% in 4QFY23. VEDL’s net debt stood at ~INR445b and net debt/EBITDA rose to 1.3x in FY23 from 0.5x in FY22. Coal linkage for the aluminum business stood at 66% and with the commissioning of Jamkhani mines it should improve further to 80% by endFY24, thereby lowering CoP in the coming quarters.
