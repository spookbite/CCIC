"  May 29, 2023 / 06:40 AM IST  ","Hot Stocks | Here's why you should bet on Cummins India, JM Financial for short term","The Nifty has managed to reach the summit so far this year, reclaiming 18,500 with the participation of recent laggard, Reliance Industries and importantly, the IT space which is finally finding its mojo back after a nearly 15-month slumber.The BFSI counters, too, participated but not to the tune of they generally do during such rallies. Nevertheless, the banking index seems to be spending some time before it surpasses the all-time high to enter an uncharted territory.Now, as far as the Nifty is concerned, we can see breakout happening on daily time frame chart which is likely to unfold in the next leg of the rally to head towards 18,700 first and then, if the momentum persists, the new high is imminent soon.On the flipside, 18,350, followed by 18,200, should be considered as immediate supports. Ideally, in case of any blip in the current week, we are likely to see buying emerging from the mentioned demand zone. Traders are advised to stick to optimistic stance and use intra-week dips to add bullish bets.Here are two buy calls for next 2-3 weeks:JM Financial: Buy | LTP: Rs 71.30 | Stop-Loss: Rs 66.20 | Target: Rs 80 | Return: 12 percentAfter establishing a solid foundation around Rs 60 levels, the stock prices have experienced significant upward momentum in recent weeks. This upward movement is supported by a notable increase in trading volumes, which is a positive sign for the bulls.Furthermore, the prices have successfully maintained a position well above the 200-SMA (simple moving average), which previously posed a substantial obstacle, suggesting a shift in market dynamics.Additionally, the RSI (relative strength index) smoothened on the weekly chart has recently signaled a fresh buying opportunity, entering into positive territory and indicating renewed interest in purchasing this stock.Based on the above evidences, we recommend buying for a trading target of Rs 80. The stop-loss can be placed at Rs 66.20.Cummins India: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,735 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,688 | Target: Rs 1,820 | Return: 5 percentThis has been a steady outperformer in the capital goods space for the last many months now. The stock has seen a series of ‘Higher Highs Higher Lows’ in all time frame charts without any major correction.Recently, stock prices underwent a decent price wise and time wise correction phase. However, with the last two days of strong upsurge, the stock has confirmed a breakout from previous wise which also led to opening of an uncharted territory.Looking at the higher volumes, we expect the stock to continue its output performance. We recommend buying for a near-term target of Rs 1,820. The strict stop-loss needs to be placed at Rs 1,688.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

"  May 29, 2023 / 08:19 AM IST  ","MC Exclusive | Race for HDFC Credila: BPEA EQT, Chrys Capital & Faering Capital consortium in the lead","A consortium of BPEA EQT, formerly Baring PE Asia, Chrys Capital and Faering Capital has emerged as the frontrunner in a big-ticket deal which is part of the Reserve Bank of India's requirement for the HDFC-HDFC Bank merger. The consortium is looking to pick up a majority stake in education loan provider HDFC Credila, multiple industry sources told Moneycontrol.On May 22, Moneycontrol was the first to report that a Baring PE EQT led consortium was the frontrunner to pick up a majority stake of around 90 percent in HDFC Credila. The valuation expectation was around Rs 10,000 crore.In April, ahead of the merger with HDFC Bank, the banking regulator directed HDFC to reduce its stake in subsidiary HDFC Credila to 10 percent within two years without onboarding new customers. Established in 2006, HDFC Credila is India's first dedicated education loan company."" The transaction has received a lot of interest from several PE suitors. Currently, the combine of BPEA EQT, Chrys Capital and Faering Capital has an edge over others and is keen to join hands and acquire a combined 90 percent stake in HDFC Credila,” said one of the persons mentioned above. “If discussions progress well, a deal is likely to be signed in the next few weeks.""Two other persons also confirmed the development.""There is too much reliance on the IT segment for Baring PE Asia and they are keen to grow big in other sectors as well like financial services and pharma and healthcare,"" one of them said.A fourth person told Moneycontrol that HDFC was expecting a valuation of around Rs 10,000 crore for Credila, which, if sealed, would make the transaction one of the biggest by India Inc in 2023.All four persons spoke to Moneycontrol on the condition of anonymity.An email query sent to HDFC remained unanswered at the time of publishing this article. EQT declined to comment. Moneycontrol has sent reminders and is awaiting a response from Chrys Capital and Faering Capital. This article will be updated when we hear from them.On May 2, 2023, news agency Bloomberg reported that HDFC had picked investment bank Jefferies for the sale process of HDFC Credila.Recently, HDFC CEO Keki Mistry said the parent had received a lot of interest for a stake buy Credila and that the firm was likely to take a call by June.“We are willing to look at reducing our stake in the company from 100 percent to 10 percent and a variety of people are calling and making bids, so we are still collating all that,” Mistry said in an investor call on HDFC's Q4 and FY 23 results.Following EQT's acquisition of Baring PE Asia in 2022, BPEA was integrated with the EQT platform and is now known as BPEA EQT, operating as EQT's private equity business line alongside EQT's infrastructure and real estate businesses in Asia. It also holds a minority stake in private sector lender RBL Bank.According to its website, in the financial services space, Chrys Capital backs the likes of Bandhan Mutual Fund, Hero Fin Corp and Varthana, which provides loans and services to affordable private schools in India.Faering Capital's recent investments include Digit Insurance, Finova Capital and WheelsEMI and others.Credila — The saga and statsIn November 2009, HDFC announced the acquisition of a 41 percent stake in HDFC Credila Financial Services, marking its entry into the segment. HDFC purchased the 41 percent equity from DSP Merrill Lynch Capital Ltd, an Indian subsidiary of global financial services major Merrill Lynch. Then in December 2019, the mortgage lender took complete control by acquiring a 9.12 percent stake from the promoter Bohora family, valuing the entire company at Rs 4,331 crore.According to reports, HDFC Credila has extended loans to 1.2 lakh customers. In FY23, its gross loan assets grew 73 percent year on year to Rs 15,298 crore, with PAT at Rs 276 crore and a net interest margin of 4 percent.According to its website, the firm has funded Indian students going to 50 plus countries, more than 3,400 institutes and studying 1,800 different courses.""Unlike banks, which typically charge a fixed rate for a certain category of students, HDFC Credila has a range of rates depending on the institute, co-borrower details, collateral security offered and the academic background of the student,"" the website says.Credila provides an education loan approval letter even before the student gets confirmed admission with the real loan getting disbursed later, the website adds.According to a February 10 report by Care Ratings, non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) almost doubled their market share in retail education loans (edu retail) in the last two years from 9.9 percent in September 2020 to 18.6 percent in September 2022. Retail education loan AUM of CARE-rated NBFCs increased from Rs 7,738 crore as on September 2020 to Rs 17,877 crore as on September 2022.""The growth rate is expected to remain strong during FY23 aided by an improved demand scenario for overseas education among Indian students. Though growth rates may moderate in FY24 due to the base effect, evolving changes in the industry, especially on the demand side, are likely to support double-digit AUM growth,"" the report added.",HDFC Bank Ltd.
"  May 29, 2023 / 07:55 AM IST  ",Hiring winter continues in tech space but Info Edge's Hitesh Oberoi finds captives hot,"The effect of the slowdown in IT hiring is now visible in the numbers of recruitment companies as well, with Info Edge, the owner of jobs portal Naukri, the latest to call out the slowdown.The company has said that its growth in billings is being impacted due to the slowdown in IT hiring while the rest of the economy is solid. Speaking to analysts, Chief Executive Officer Hitesh Oberoi said that global concerns are likely to impact prospects of clients in the IT services space, although they are optimistic about hiring by captives and global capability centres (GCCs).The cautious spending by Info Edge’s IT customers on hiring is in line with the slowdown in net addition numbers given by India’s top IT companies, with there being a 69 percent drop in net addition numbers in FY23 as compared to the preceding year. Net addition is considered an indicator of demand, and all IT majors have signalled caution about the demand environment. Most have not committed to fresher hiring targets either.ALSO READ: Info Edge Q4 net loss widens sequentially to Rs 273 crore, operating margin weakensInfo Edge stating that the recruitment business is witnessing a cautious spending environment from its IT customers is significant as 50 percent of the company’s recruitment billing comes from IT, and the remaining from non-IT.Oberoi expects IT hiring to remain slow for at least 4-5 months, and hopes that it will recover in the second half of the fiscal. With non-IT recruitment being strong currently, he said it could be challenging for the company if the economy turns.He added that 30 percent of the company’s business comes from recruitment firms that hire for IT companies, which get impacted first when there's a slowdown as their services are expensive, leading to their spend on Naukri reducing.Oberoi said that IT hiring, which has been slumping for the last few months, will continue to be slow for at least a few quarters, and its unclear if it hit the bottom so far.“We expect things to continue to be like they are for some more time. A lot will depend on what happens to the US economy,” he said.While it has previously happened that Indian IT starts to benefit during slowdowns as companies that want to cut costs in the US lead to more jobs being outsourced to India, Oberoi said it is hard to say if the same will happen this time around.Oberoi hoped that the boom when it comes to AI will end up creating more opportunities for Indian IT services going forward. However, with regard to the recruitment business, he said it is unlikely that the company will hike pricing in IT.",Info Edge (India) Ltd.

However, there is scope to gain further market share in tractor segment due to new launches, he added.Catch all the market action on our live blogHere is what brokerages have to say about stock and the company post-March quarter earnings:Motilal OswalWhile the outlook for tractors remains stable, broking houses expect the Auto business to be the key growth driver for the next couple of years. Despite the deterioration in the mix, it estimates revenue/EBITDA/PAT CAGRs of ~14/19/16 percent over FY23-25E, respectively.The implied core P/E for MM stands at 14.2x/12.5x FY24E/FY25E EPS.While the valuation is still cheap compared to peers, it has seen a substantial rerating in FY23 as the stock is now trading in line with its five-year average core PE (against a discount of 30 percent earlier) driven by a strong performance in the SUV segment, market share gain in tractors and new launch pipeline in EVs.Motilal Oswal maintained a Buy rating with a Target Price of Rs 1,500/share (Mar’25E based on SOTP).SharekhanPost reporting in line operating performance, M&M has guided for low single-digit growth in the tractor industry in FY2024 and has indicated that, excluding the supply chain constraints, it has largely achieved its targeted capacity in the PV segment.Further, the company is strategically focussing on achieving a leadership position in most of its operating segments and is aiming to grow its non-core business as per its potential. M&M is consistently improving its profitability, as this was the consecutive 5th quarter when the automotive segment as well as the FES segment reported sequential improvement in EBIT margin.Historically, M&M’s operating performance has largely depended on the tractor segment; however, Sharekhan believes the auto segment is expected to drive its operating performance in the coming years due to increasing volumes going ahead.It maintains a Buy rating with an SOTP-based price target (PT) of Rs 1,550 (16.5xFY25 core EPS, Rs. 334 for listed subsidiaries and Rs. 209 for the EV arm) on consistent improvement in profitability, focus on disciplined capital allocation, and aim to achieve market leadership in its operating areas.Also Read - M&M to roll out new lightweight platform for Swaraj TractorsNirmal BangMahindra and Mahindra management indicated that open bookings as of May’23 stood at more than 292,000 units.

It has received good traction for its recently launched electric variant of XUV400 with order bookings of more than 20,000 units. Moreover, in order to meet the growing demand and reduce the long waiting periods, M&M is expanding its UV capacity by 49,000 units by FY24-end.For the Auto segment, the broking firm is building in ~12 percent volume CAGR over FY23-FY25, led by new capacity addition and a strong order book. For the FES segment, the company has guided for industry-wide volume growth of low single digits for FY24.Nirmal Bang believes that with the increase in production levels, softening RM costs and improvement in the product mix, margins will improve going ahead.It expects 12 percent and 6 percent volume CAGR for Auto and FES segments respectively over FY23-FY25, and estimates 12 percent CAGR in revenue over FY23-FY25.The core business is valued at ~16x FY25E core EPS owing to a strong order book and robust demand outlook, while the other listed entities are valued at the current market value to arrive at a target price (TP) of Rs 1,558.

"  May 29, 2023 / 06:03 PM IST  ","ONGC plans Rs 30,125 crore capex, sees output increasing in FY24 ","State run-Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd plans a capital expenditure of Rs 30,125 crore in 2023-24 as against a Rs 30,208 crore in the previous year, financed primarily from internal accruals.The oil exploration company said that in the last five years, it has spent around Rs 1,44,000 crore on capital expenditure.“One of the greatest things to have happened in the history of ONGC is that the government’s new gas pricing policy pegs the floor at $4/ mmBtu and ceiling at $6.5/mmBtu. Assuming that this price continues at $6.5 for two years and there onwards there is 25 paise increase, and assuming that crude remains above $70 (per barrel)...ONGC’s revenue stream will remain robust,"" Chairman Arun Kumar Singh told reporters.“Cash flow wise, I don’t think ONGC will be required to go anywhere to raise funds,” he said.The administered price mechanism (APM) gas, or gas produced by legacy fields, or nomination fields of ONGC, is now priced at 10 percent of the price of the India crude basket, but capped at $6.5/mmBtu. The floor or base price is $4/mmBtu.Shares of ONGC declined almost 3 percent on May 29 to end at Rs 158.90 on the BSE, after the company reported a decline in its consolidated net profit, late evening on May 27. The net profit for the fourth quarter of FY23 plummeted to Rs 5,701 crore from Rs 12,061.44 crore in the corresponding period last year after the company made provision of Rs 12,107 crore towards disputed service tax and GST on royalty and interest on it in the period between April 1, 2016 and to March 31, 2023.

But the company expects the trend to reverse and the output to increase, boosted by Block KG-DWN 98/2 in the Bay of Bengal.In 2023-34, ONGC expects production to grow 11.6 percent year-on-year.ICICI Securities in a note post the results, said, “Given that KG basin gas would qualify for premium pricing and that international prices would likely remain well above the historical levels, we see net gas realisations at Rs21.7/scm and Rs22.8/scm for FY24E and FY25E vs Rs22.2/scm for FY23.

These include a 49.9 per cent stake in the Vankorneft oil and gas field and another 29.9 per cent in the TAAS-Yuryakh Neftegazodobycha fields.They get dividends on profits made by the operating consortium from selling oil and gas produced from the fields. Soon after invading Ukraine in February last year, Russia put restrictions on repatriation of dollars to check volatility in foreign exchange rates.OVL, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), got its last dividend back in July 2022. One dividend payout that came after that is lying in the company's account in Russia.Its managing director Rajarshi Gupta said the dividend income lying in Russia is ""less than USD 100 million."" ""We are not in a hurry to get it back as the company has capital and operating expenses for the three projects in Russia,"" he said. ""It is business as usual as far as dividend is concerned."" OVL holds interest in Russia through a Singapore subsidiary.Moscow declared Singapore as an unfriendly nation last year and so money from Russia cannot flow to any company incorporated in that country.He said the company is looking at right banking channels and discussions are on. Last week, Oil India officials said USD 300 million dividend income of the company and its partners are stuck in Russia.The consortium of OIL, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and Bharat PetroResources Ltd has stakes in two projects.The USD 300 million dividend was lying with the Commercial Indo Bank LLC (CIBL), which was a joint venture of State Bank of India and Canara Bank. Canara Bank in March sold its 40 per cent stake in CIBL to SBI.The dividend from TAAS was paid on a quarterly basis, while Vankorneft's earnings were paid half-yearly. The Indian firms are looking at options of how to repatriate the money from Russia, he said.OVL holds a 26 per cent stake in Suzunskoye, Tagulskoye and Lodochnoye fields -- collectively known as the Vankor cluster in the north-eastern part of West Siberia.Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Oil India Ltd (OIL) and Bharat PetroResources Ltd (a unit of Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd or BPCL) hold another 23.9 per cent in Vankor. Russia's Rosneft is the operator with 50.1 per cent interest.The consortium of OIL, IOC and Bharat PetroResources has a 29.9 per cent stake in TAAS-Yuryakh Neftegazodobycha.
