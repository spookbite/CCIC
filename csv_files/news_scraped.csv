Thanks to its positioning and affordability, Royal Enfield’s dominance has been so strong over the years that Harley-Davidson, which was at the higher end of the higher end, abruptly exited India in 2020. But the American bike maker has now come back and is looking to eat into RE’s market share.On July 3, Hero Motocorp and Harley launched the Harley Davidson X440, which comes with a 440cc engine. Its peak torque and power are 35-40 percent higher than Royal Enfield’s Classic 350. The bike’s starting price, at Rs 2.29 lakh is at a 15 percent premium to the Classic 350cc and Meteor 350cc.After all, the segment is a juicy one with high margins so everyone wants a piece of the pie. “The >250cc market may have space for 2-3 players. The high gross margins of RE at ~43 percent, Rs 75,000 per bike, make the segment attractive for new players,” wrote analysts at Nomura.But, as consumers get spoiled for choice, it’s bad news for shareholders of Eicher Motors. RE, which commands 90 percent market share in the segment, with 735,000 units sold in India in FY23, now stands to lose some steam despite the market size growing.“The premium bike segment is expected to grow at twice the rate of the underlying two-wheeler market growth. The two-wheeler market is expected to grow at 6-7 percent, but the premium bike market will grow 12-15 percent over the next five years,” says Jinesh Gandhi, senior vice president (equity research) at Motilal Oswal Financial Services.For any player starting with zero market share, this is a lucrative opportunity. The same happened during the launch of the Jawa and Honda premium bikes. The dent wasn’t large but they did chip into RE’s market share, say analysts.Moreover, Harley has always been an aspirational brand, with models starting above Rs 5 lakh. Now back with lower price points, it could force RE to suffer higher market share erosion.According to Sreedhar Prasad, consumer sector expert and ex-partner, KPMG, the new Harley Davidson model targets three categories. First, the bike-lover looking for a ‘swanky’ purchase. Second, the ‘RE Bullet loyalists’ who can now upgrade to a Harley by paying a few thousand more. Third, upper middle class men and women in their forties, fascinated by the sleeker, retro look, who may not be owning a bike now“Bullet has always had the image of being over-macho and extremely heavy,” he said.For Royal Enfield, which contributes 90 percent to Eicher Motors’ bottom line, the threat is not only from Harley Davidson but also from Triumph’s Speed 400 and Scrambler 400X. The Speed 400, a street naked motorcycle that takes styling inspiration from the bigger Street Twin 900, has been priced at an aggressive Rs 2.33 lakh. The models are in partnership with Bajaj Auto.Talking to CNBC-Awaaz, Rajiv Bajaj said, “Royal Enfield is the bank and we are all set to rob that bank.”Also Read: Bajaj-Triumph collaboration makes Speed 400 an affordable aspiration for customers, says Rajiv BajajFive years back, Bajaj had trolled Enfield with a series of ‘Haathi mat palo’ ads, in which Enfield was compared to an elephant.

If the Triumph bikes are able to create a brand perception in the affordable aspiration segment, it will be a huge win for Bajaj, which has constantly tried to grow by breaking into higher-powered categories.Royal Enfield is also staring at competition from the relaunch of Bajaj’s Pulsar and Hero’s Karizma brands, both are expected to sport around 200cc engines.In this heated competitive environment, analysts believe the valuation premium commanded by Eicher Motors over Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto is slightly unjustified.

The recent announcements by BPCL and IOCL, two of India's major state-owned OMCs, to raise equity capital are expected to boost their spending on capital projects and enhance the credibility of their plans to reduce emissions, as per the global rating agency.As part of the budget in February 2023, the government announced an allocation of Rs 30,000 crore (approximately $3.7 billion) for capital support to the OMCs. Fitch Ratings believes that the equity injection aligns with these plans.Fitch Ratings expects Indian OMCs to turn profitable in FY24 as crude oil prices decline to the estimation of around $78.8 per barrel.

"  July 06, 2023 / 10:56 AM IST  ",Reduce Eicher Motors; target of Rs 3086: HDFC Securities,"HDFC Securities' research report on Eicher MotorsWe downgrade Eicher Motors to REDUCE (from ADD earlier) as a significant increase in competitive intensity has changed the business dynamics unfavourably for RE. Over the last two days, both Harley Davidson (in partnership with Hero MotoCorp) and Triumph (in partnership with Bajaj Auto) have launched cruiser bikes at extremely competitive and similar price points, which are marginally higher than RE’s best-selling Classic350cc (Chrome). What leaves us confused is the fact that while pricing is aggressive, both players seem to have very limited capacity to start with. We hence believe that this is likely to be introductory pricing and unlikely to be sustainable in the long run for the features/brands on offer. Nevertheless, RE would be forced to reconsider its pricing/brand strategy very quickly, which will in turn drive margin pressure.OutlookAccordingly, we have now lowered our earnings estimates by 16-18% over FY24-25E as we revisit our growth and margin estimates. As a result, our TP is reduced to INR 3,086 per share (from INR 3,715 per share earlier). We expect RE to be in a much better position to fight back once this competitive pricing stabilizes. However, if these competitive price points sustain for a higher-than-expected time, it would lead to further downside risks to our estimates.For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

"  July 06, 2023 / 09:21 AM IST  ",Godrej Consumer expects double-digit volume growth in Q1. What should you do?,"Godrej Consumer Product Ltd (GCPL), a leading fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) player, anticipates a significant increase in volume for the first quarter of the current financial year.On a consolidated basis (organic), the company foresees a high-single-digit growth in volume and nearly double-digit growth in sales in rupee terms. The overall sales growth including inorganic is expected to reach double digits, it said in a business update on July 5.The company mentioned that the sales growth exceeded the mid-single-digit range slightly, as it passed on the advantages of reduced input costs to the consumers.The international business of GCPL, which includes regions such as Africa, the USA, and the Middle East (GAUM), achieved constant currency sales growth in the mid-teens.Several brokerages share the expectation that the company will maintain its growth momentum. The optimism is supported by GCPL's investments in the grooming category, continuous development of new product categories, and a focus on expanding the high-margin and high-return on capital employed (RoCE) domestic business.These initiatives are anticipated to contribute to a strong medium-to-long-term earnings growth outlook for the company.Here’s what brokerages have to say on the Q1 business update:Nomura ResearchNomura anticipates robust growth for GCPL in the medium term, primarily driven by increased volumes in India's household insecticides (HI) segment as well as in hair care and hair colour products.The management aims to achieve double-digit growth over this period. The company's market development activities across different regions, coupled with higher advertising expenditures compared to the industry average, are expected to contribute to this growth.The Indonesian business is also experiencing a revival in growth, while GCPL continues to witness improved growth in the GAUM (Godrej Africa, USA, and Middle East) region.The company is also poised to benefit from an enhanced gross profit margin (GPM) and operating profit margin (OPM) profile due to a more favourable product mix and lower input costs, such as palm oil and crude oil.The brokerage firm has maintained “buy” rating on the stock and increased its target price to Rs 1,150 a share from Rs 1,062.Nuvama ResearchIn the organic segment, the India business is projected to experience a year-on-year (YoY) growth of 9.5 percent. This growth will be primarily driven by an 11 percent increase in volume, offset by negative pricing growth in soaps.Despite an anticipated rise in advertising expenditures for GCPL, the company is expected to witness an expansion in gross and EBITDA margins by 421 basis points and 256 basis points from the previous year.One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.Nuvama predicts a significant year-on-year (YoY) increase in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA), excluding Raymond Consumer Care Limited (RCCL). However, there will be a one-time expense related to stamp duty paid for the slump sale transaction of Park Avenue and KamaSutra brands, acquired from RCCL.RCCL's sales will be incorporated for approximately six-seven weeks in Q1FY24, and Nuvama expects primary sales to be weak due to inventory reduction.On the international business front, Indonesia is projected to achieve a healthy double-digit growth rate of 12-13 percent YoY. This growth is attributed to a soft base (a decline of 12 percent YoY in constant currency terms in the previous year) and the implementation of structural changes last year.The brokerage firm has maintained the “buy” rating on the stock and kept its target price at Rs 1,145 a share.CitiCiti has assigned a “buy” rating to Godrej Consumer with a target of Rs 1,175 a share. In their Q1FY24 update, they express confidence in the company's ability to sustain double-digit domestic volume growth, indicating that the company is heading in the right direction.It anticipates improved performance across various segments and will closely monitor any initiatives related to household insecticides in India.",Godrej Consumer Products Ltd.
"  July 06, 2023 / 01:07 PM IST  ",Will Hero and Bajaj eat up Eicher Motors’ lunch?,"Eicher Motors’ Royal Enfield (RE) has for long been the king of premium bikes in the country. Thanks to its positioning and affordability, Royal Enfield’s dominance has been so strong over the years that Harley-Davidson, which was at the higher end of the higher end, abruptly exited India in 2020. But the American bike maker has now come back and is looking to eat into RE’s market share.On July 3, Hero Motocorp and Harley launched the Harley Davidson X440, which comes with a 440cc engine. Its peak torque and power are 35-40 percent higher than Royal Enfield’s Classic 350. The bike’s starting price, at Rs 2.29 lakh is at a 15 percent premium to the Classic 350cc and Meteor 350cc.After all, the segment is a juicy one with high margins so everyone wants a piece of the pie. “The >250cc market may have space for 2-3 players. The high gross margins of RE at ~43 percent, Rs 75,000 per bike, make the segment attractive for new players,” wrote analysts at Nomura.But, as consumers get spoiled for choice, it’s bad news for shareholders of Eicher Motors. RE, which commands 90 percent market share in the segment, with 735,000 units sold in India in FY23, now stands to lose some steam despite the market size growing.“The premium bike segment is expected to grow at twice the rate of the underlying two-wheeler market growth. The two-wheeler market is expected to grow at 6-7 percent, but the premium bike market will grow 12-15 percent over the next five years,” says Jinesh Gandhi, senior vice president (equity research) at Motilal Oswal Financial Services.For any player starting with zero market share, this is a lucrative opportunity. The same happened during the launch of the Jawa and Honda premium bikes. The dent wasn’t large but they did chip into RE’s market share, say analysts.Moreover, Harley has always been an aspirational brand, with models starting above Rs 5 lakh. Now back with lower price points, it could force RE to suffer higher market share erosion.According to Sreedhar Prasad, consumer sector expert and ex-partner, KPMG, the new Harley Davidson model targets three categories. First, the bike-lover looking for a ‘swanky’ purchase. Second, the ‘RE Bullet loyalists’ who can now upgrade to a Harley by paying a few thousand more. Third, upper middle class men and women in their forties, fascinated by the sleeker, retro look, who may not be owning a bike now“Bullet has always had the image of being over-macho and extremely heavy,” he said.For Royal Enfield, which contributes 90 percent to Eicher Motors’ bottom line, the threat is not only from Harley Davidson but also from Triumph’s Speed 400 and Scrambler 400X. The Speed 400, a street naked motorcycle that takes styling inspiration from the bigger Street Twin 900, has been priced at an aggressive Rs 2.33 lakh. The models are in partnership with Bajaj Auto.Talking to CNBC-Awaaz, Rajiv Bajaj said, “Royal Enfield is the bank and we are all set to rob that bank.”Also Read: Bajaj-Triumph collaboration makes Speed 400 an affordable aspiration for customers, says Rajiv BajajFive years back, Bajaj had trolled Enfield with a series of ‘Haathi mat palo’ ads, in which Enfield was compared to an elephant. That was done to promote Bajaj’s Dominar 400 bikes, which, however, failed to make a mark as the ‘elephant’ stood strong. If the Triumph bikes are able to create a brand perception in the affordable aspiration segment, it will be a huge win for Bajaj, which has constantly tried to grow by breaking into higher-powered categories.Royal Enfield is also staring at competition from the relaunch of Bajaj’s Pulsar and Hero’s Karizma brands, both are expected to sport around 200cc engines.In this heated competitive environment, analysts believe the valuation premium commanded by Eicher Motors over Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto is slightly unjustified. Saji John, equity research analyst at Geojit BNP Paribas, said, “Given Royal Enfield’s brand recall, it is too early to give a verdict. But a contraction in the valuation gap is plausible.”This has also been visible in the stock movements over the past few days.Hero Moto has gained over 10 percent in the past five trading sessions while Bajaj Auto spiked 6 percent soon after unveiling its new launches with Triumph. Eicher Motors on the other hand has corrected over 8 percent.In May, Motilal Oswal Financial Services had valued Eicher Motors at 24.5x one-year forward earnings per share. This has now contracted to 23.8x. Meanwhile, Hero Moto, which was valued at 15x, now commands a 16x 1-year forward P/E.Clearly, there are exciting times ahead for two-wheeler lovers. And nervous moments for Eicher Motors shareholders.
