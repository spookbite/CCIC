"  May 12, 2023 / 08:07 PM IST  ","Megha Engineering beats L&T to bag Rs 14,400-crore Thane-Borivali twin tunnel project","Hyderabad-based Megha Engineering & Infrastructures Ltd (MEIL) beat engineering major Larsen & Toubro Ltd (L&T) to bag two separate packages to build the ambitious Thane-Borivali twin tunnel project in Mumbai for a total bid of Rs 14,400 crore, top officials told Moneycontrol.“We have awarded the letter of offer to MEIL after they emerged as the best bidder,” MMRDA Commissioner SVR Srinivas confirmed to Moneycontrol.MMRDA, the state agency executing this project, floated a tender in January 2023 for two packages of civil construction work for the tunnel project that aims to reduce the travel time from Thane to Mumbai's western suburbs from 60 minutes to 15-20 minutes. The tunnels will also substantially cut carbon emissions from vehicles on that route.“The work may start after the monsoon. This project is important for the connectivity in the region,” Srinivas said.L&T and MEIL were the only two bidders when the technical bids were opened in April. When the financial bids were opened on April 25, MEIL was the lowest bidder for ‘Package 1’. L&T’s bid was the lowest for ‘Package 2’ but it was rejected later as the company had inadvertently mentioned the amount as the final bid but had not added the tax component to it, as required by the tender.Subsequently, L&T moved the Bombay high court earlier this month, challenging its disqualification for ‘Package 1’ and asking the court to direct MMRDA to award the company ‘Package 2’. But the court rejected the two petitions.Query sent to L&T and MEIL remained unanswered.The project entails the construction of two road tunnels of 10.8 km each under the Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) and the approach roads on both ends, which will provide a shorter route to commuters and help them bypass the congested route they currently use.MEIL was the lowest bidder at Rs 7,464 crore for ‘Package 1’ which entails designing and construction of 5.75 kilometers from the Borivali side for the twin tunnel project.L&T’s bid for ‘Package 2’ was Rs 6,625 crore but it was rejected as the amount would have been higher to factor in the taxes, officials said. MEIL bagged ‘Package 2’ which entails designing and construction of 6.09 kilometers from the Thane side for the twin tunnel project with a bid of bid Rs 6,937 crore.The tunnels will have three lanes each and connect Ekta Nagar, Magathane in Borivali and Tikuji-Ni-Wadi at Manpada in Thane. The tunnel road will help reduce traffic congestion on Ghodbunder Road in Thane.While announcing the project in July 2021, Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde, who was the  Urban Development Minister at the time, had said that extra care will be taken to avoid any impact on the biodiversity of the national park.",Larsen & Toubro Ltd.

The rural and semi-urban markets grew faster than the urban market for the first time in the past few quarters. In the paints business, PIDI launched decorative paint, ‘Haisha’, after a careful survey and receiving input from dealers. It is currently launched in test markets (AP and Telengana) and the company will not rush to launch it nationally. PIDI will use the existing distribution network and facilities for ‘Haisha’ and it has adequate capacity to scale it if required. Although the sharp material cost reduction could lead to healthy earnings growth over FY23-FY25, expensive valuations lead us to reiterate our Neutral rating on the stock.OutlookNevertheless, expensive valuation of ~58xFY25E EPS more than discounts this growth and does not leave room for any upside.

"  May 12, 2023 / 05:22 PM IST  ",Buy SRF; target of Rs 2960: Sharekhan,"Sharekhan's research report on SRFQ4FY23 numbers show strength in chemical segment, which helped deliver strong 10% q-o-q growth in consolidated PAT to Rs. 562 crore (5% above our estimate) despite demand/margin headwinds for packaging film/technical textile businesses. Chemical segment EBIT grew by 47% y-o-y/31% q-o-q and was well significantly above our expectation, led by beat of 16%/700 bps in revenues/margins, given phenomenal performance by both fluorochemical and specialty chemical businesses. Packaging film’s EBIT declined by 85%/65% y-o-y/q-o-q to Rs. 41 crore as margins plunged by 1,629/631 bps y-o-y/q-o-q to just 3.6% amid soft BOPET/BOPP spreads. Technical textile segment’s EBIT improved q-o-q but still remains well below normal level given weak NTCF demand. Management was confident with its 20%+ revenue guidance and sustained high margin guidance for chemical segment despite a high base (revenue/EBIT growth of 41%/68% in FY23). Pharma CDMO foray plan and commercialization of 7-8 new AIs over next two years could be key catalyst for growth going forward.OutlookStock price has run-up sharply by 18% from March lows but is still 10% below 52-week high of Rs. 2,864 and thus riskreward seems favourable given expectations of a 20% PAT CAGR over FY23-25E, efficient capital allocation (high capex intensity for chemical business) and a reasonable valuation of 25x its FY2025E EPS. Hence, we maintain a Buy on SRF with an unchanged PT of Rs. 2,960.

The beat on our estimates stemmed from above estimated strong performance in the chemicals business segment. The packaging film and technical textile business on the other hand continued to suffer headwinds. The operating margins in packaging film business declined further during the quarter and is perhaps at its cyclical bottom, however recovery could still take few more months. The chemicals business on the other hand has a strong prognosis, with more than 20% revenue growth expected in FY24. The growth is expected to be fueled by seven specialty chemical plants and three fluorochemical plants on course for commissioning in FY24 along with 7-8 new active ingredients under development and due for commercialization in coming years. The PTFE plant while slightly delayed is now due for commissioning by mid-Jun’23, whereas the R-32 plant is due for commissioning in Jul’23, thereby likely to contribute to 2HFY24 earnings.OutlookMaintain BUY with a Mar’24 TP of Rs 3135/sh.
