"  June 01, 2023 / 04:18 PM IST  ",Buy Coal India; target of Rs 290: Motilal Oswal,"Motilal Oswal's research report on Coal IndiaCOAL has approved a price revision for its high grade G2-G10 non-coking coal w.e.f. 31st May 2023. COAL has hiked prices by 8%, which is expected to realize an incremental revenue of INR27b in FY24. The last FSA price revision was taken in 2018 and COAL has now taken the first major price hike. This is expected to offset almost 50% of higher wage bill, following the mutual agreement between COAL and four central trade unions under NCWA-XI. The price hike affects ~30% of the volumes. The wage bill is expected to increase by ~INR60b in FY24, post the recent negotiations. This price hike would likely offset ~50% of the incremental wage bill. We have increased our revenue estimates by 2% to factor in the incremental revenues due to the price hike. The e-auction premiums have drastically come off in April and May and the near-term outlook on premiums remain soft.OutlookWe have increased our EBITDA/APAT estimate by 2.4%/2.5% to factor in the price hike benefit, which would be partially offset by the lower e-auction premiums. COAL trades at EV/EBITDA of 3.9x FY24E. We reiterate our BUY rating on the stock with a revised target price of INR290 (5x EV/EBITDA). We believe COAL is well placed to capitalize on the growth opportunity ahead.For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

TRP continues to outperform the industry in the branded generics segment, with revenue growth of 12.6% YoY in FY23 and EBITDA margin gain of 130bp YoY for the segment.  We trim our FY24/FY25 EPS estimates by 4%/1% to factor in 1) incremental expenses for the consumer healthcare platform, 2) a gradual revival in US sales, and 3) improved growth momentum in the LATAM business. We value TRP at 26x 12M forward earnings to arrive at a TP of INR1650. The company continues to focus on the branded generics business in its key markets of India/Brazil. The strategy of building a consumer healthcare segment in India would further enhance volume growth potential for certain established brands. While a successful resolution of compliance issues is vital for growth in US generics, it has outsourced certain products, which would aid growth in US generics to some extent. Having said this, the current valuation adequately captures the upside in earnings.
