"  June 19, 2023 / 10:03 AM IST  ",Beauty segment to help Nykaa outrun market growth rate: What do analysts say?,"Nykaa-owner FSN E-Commerce Ventures Ltd traded marginally higher in the opening hours on June 19. The stock shed nearly 7 percent so far this year, while it gained nearly 13 percent since March 28.The stock is still down 65 percent from its all-time high of Rs 415.52 hit on December 1, 2021 and nearly 42 percent from its 52-week high scaled on July 26, 2022.In its recent investor meet, Nykaa talked about a future of robust growth in its BPC (beauty and personal care) business, with the beauty products driving the growth. This rally will largely be fuelled by high-income and upper middle-class consumers who play a vital role in the BPC industry growth. By strategically targeting this customer segment, Nykaa aims to position itself for accelerated growth and outrun the market.Nykaa intends to firm up its fashion business by prioritising private labels to enhance customer loyalty and reduce marketing expenses. The company is focused on continuous investments in new verticals, particularly the SuperStore (eB2B) concept, to expand its operations and achieve scalability in an evolving marketplace.Nykaa indicated that the EBITDA margins for both the BPC and fashion segments are expected to range from low to mid-teens. Additionally, the Superstore vertical is projected to achieve margins within the 3-5 percent range. The company has lowered its marketing and fulfillment expenses from the previous year to enhance operational efficiency.Nomura has retained its 'buy' rating and kept the target price unchanged at Rs 183 a share. Nuvama has kept 'buy' tag and unchanged target price at Rs 186 a share, Kotak has maintained buy ratings and unchanged target price at Rs 210 a share. Meanwhile, Jefferies India has a bullish call on the stock with a buy ratings and expects 39 percent increase in the stock to Rs 200 a share from current market price.Let's take a look at what analysts say:Nomura ResearchWe continue to estimate a strong 25 percent CAGR for BPC over FY23-30. However, we factor in the fashion CAGR at 13 percent with a terminal year mix of 5 percent to NSV. We factor in the overall revenue CAGR of 25 percent over FY23-30 and EBITDA margin to expand to 12.7 percent by FY30 (from 5.4 percent). With major expenses on employee costs and warehousing behind, we believe the steady margin expansion should continue over the next few years.Nuvama ResearchStable growth in BPC, along with profitability improvement, is admirable. Going forward, comfort on competition, given two large independent beauty platforms have been launched in the last one year, and cash flow generation (debt moderation), as per us can drive re-rating.Kotak Institutional ResearchNykaa incurred Rs 2.5 billion of losses in FY2023 from fashion and the new verticals (eB2B, Nykaa Man). We believe this can go down to Rs 2.1 billion in FY2025 as channel economics improve. B2B is a competitive space and, for now, we do not bake in any major value creation from it. We retain our estimates with an unchanged FV of Rs 210. Maintain buy.Jefferies IndiaNykaa has been able to carve out a niche for itself through its focus on BPC, which differentiates it from horizontals (Flipkart and Amazon). The recent years have seen a surge in transacting customers for the company. Nykaa should benefit from the increasing order frequencies and basket values, as the newer customer cohorts mature. We expect Nykaa  to remain in a hyper growth phase in the medium term as online BPC and fashion penetration ramps up. We built a strong order of 25 percent+ for Nykaa BPC over FY22-26, led by new customer additions. Order frequency is expected to see gradual growth as customer cohorts mature. BPC GMV is expected to grow strongly, at 25 percent CAGR over FY22-26. Fashion is expected to continue ramping up on the low base. We see 30 percent GMV CAGR for Fashion. We value Nykaa's BPC at 8x FY25 sales and Fashion at 2.5xFY25 sales to arrive at a PT of Rs 200.",FSN E-Commerce Ventures Ltd.

Considering a strong close above 18,800 and with recent laggard, BFSI space, participating in the move last Friday, we will not be surprised to see this achievement in the first half of this week.On the flip-side, the base has shifted higher towards 18,600 – 18,550, before which 18,700 could be an immediate support.We continue to remain sanguine and would reiterate on using intra-week decline to add bullish bets in the market. All eyes would be on global markets as they play a vital role in next leg of the rally.Also, it’s important for high beta financial space to start showing its buoyant nature. If things fall in place as per the expectations, we are likely to have merry run in the near term.Here are two buy calls for short term:IRCTC: Buy | LTP: Rs 665 | Stop-Loss: Rs 642 | Target: Rs 706 | Return: 6 percentThe stock has been underperforming for quite a long time now. Recently, stock prices formed a strong base around Rs 580 – 600 and started moving higher in the recent past.On Friday, we finally witnessed a decisive close above the recent hurdle of Rs 656, which confirms a breakout from the ‘Bullish Cup and Handle’ pattern on the daily time frame chart. It coincides with traversing of key moving average i.e., 200-SMA for the first time in the current calendar year.Looking at the higher volumes, we recommend buying for a trading target of Rs 706, with a stop-loss at Rs 642.United Breweries: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,512.20 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,482 | Target: Rs 1,565 | Return: 3.5 percentThis counter has been quite on and off these days. However, taking a glance at the weekly time frame chart, we can see prices cementing their position precisely at ‘200-week SMA’ placed around Rs 1,353. Now, gradually it is trying to move in the northward direction.With prices sustaining above ’89-day EMA’ for few days, we can see some buying interest coming back into this trader’s favourite stock.On Friday, it managed to confirm its close above Rs 1,500 mark with rising volumes.

"  June 19, 2023 / 10:20 AM IST  ",Benchmarks perch near all-time highs: The gainers and losers of this rally,"The Sensex and Nifty are just a whisker away from their lifetime highs. The benchmark indices finished at record closing levels in the previous session on June 16. Nifty 50 is now only 30 points away from its all-time high level, while Sensex is around 100 points short.Catch all the market action on our live blogAfter a lacklustre start to the year, Dalal Street came under heavy pressure in March as the banking crisis in US roiled the global markets. But the domestic benchmarks made a stunning turnaround from late March, in tandem with fresh FPI inflows.The Nifty is up over 11 percent from its March lows, gaining 1,875 points.The Nifty-50 has turned full circle in the last 20 months, as per Motilal Oswal. It has navigated from 18,477 in Oct’21 to an all-time high of 18,813 in Dec’22 before reverting to 18,688 in Jun’23. While the benchmark index has reclaimed the summit again, the midcap and smallcap universes have outperformed the benchmark as compared with the Dec’22 peaks.Here are some key highlights of this leg of the bull run:The GainersAdani Enterprises Ltd, the flagship company of the Adani Group, has rebounded in tandem with other group stocks after a late January report by American short-seller Hindenburg Research accused the port-to-power conglomerate of stock manipulation and other wrongdoings, triggering a rout.
