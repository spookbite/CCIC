Therefore, it is currently in oversold territory and reversed from its demand area.The texture of the chart formation and technical indicator RSI (relative strength index) is indicating the current reversal formation could lead to a new leg of the uptrend from its demand zone.In the near term, Rs 395 would be the immediate support zone for the stock. Above the same, the upward rally will continue up to Rs 440.Hindustan Petroleum CorporationOn a daily scale, the stock is trading into a rising channel chart formation making the higher top and higher bottom constantly. As a result, all major technical trend indicators such as MACD (moving average convergence divergence) and ADX (average directional index) are strong and steady.Therefore, an upward movement from the current level is very likely to continue in the coming horizon. For the traders, Rs 235 would be the key support level to watch out for. Above this the uptrend structure will continue until Rs 262.DLFOn the weekly scale, the stock has seen consolidating in a range and currently, it has rebounded from the lower boundary of the range. The structure suggests a reversal of the trend and bullish strength for a fresh up move from the current levels.For positional traders, Rs 348 would be the trend decider level.

The ship with capacity of 80,000 to 99,000 cubic metres is targeted to take deliveries from the US ports of Marcus Hook, Nederland, Morgan's Point or Beaumont and deliver ethane at Dahej or Hazira in Gujarat or Dabhol in Maharashtra.GAIL has a petrochemical plant at Pata, near Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh, and is also looking to set up another unit at Usar in Maharashtra.The company had to cut down on run rate at Pata after the government diverted gas supplies from the plant to city gas suppliers. This led to its profitability being impacted and so now the company is looking to supplement the feedstock with ethane.""For GAIL, this is a step towards achieving improved sustenance in business operations,"" the statement said on MoU signing with Shell Energy India.""In a bid towards diversification of the feedstock for its petrochemical plant, GAIL is looking to import ethane from ethane-surplus countries with matured export terminal infrastructure through water-borne transportation to India and transport it further through GAIL's pipeline systems to demand centres.""The MoU envisages to explore prospects in import and handling of different hydrocarbons which are important chemical and petrochemical precursors, LNG for road transport, regasification of imported LNG and renewables, the statement added.GAIL is India's largest natural gas company. It owns and operates a network of around 14,830 kilometres of natural gas pipelines spread across the length and breadth of the country. It commands around 68 per cent market share in gas transmission and sells 53 per cent of all gas sold in the country.Ethane is expected to be produced in large volumes in North America due to the shale gas revolution, which has generated an abundance of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). It is primarily used as petrochemical feedstock to produce ethylene by steam cracking.Ethylene is the starting material for making a wide range of products -- from packaging films, wire coatings, and squeeze bottles as well as plastics and synthetic rubber.",GAIL (India) Ltd.
"  March 17, 2023 / 01:21 PM IST  ","Macro uncertainties cast shadow on IT services, mixed views on preferred stocks","The IT services sector, which has already been suffering in the past year due to the uncertain global environment, is still not out of the woods as the macro environment continues to be turbulent, with analysts remaining cautious about the sector.The benchmark Nifty IT index has declined 19 percent in the last year, compared to the broader Nifty50 index, which fell around 1 percent.What do brokerages sayAccording to foreign brokerage Nomura, the demand uncertainty is rising and margins have bottomed out, with concerns around uncertain macro conditions, falling attrition and disciplined mergers and acquisitions.The brokerage has a ""buy"" rating on Infosys, Tech Mahindra, Persistent Systems and Coforge. However, it recommends ""reduce"" on Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), LTIMindtree (LTIM) and L&T Technologies.Morgan Stanley (MS), on the other hand, is bullish on LTIM and prefers Infosys and HCL Technologies.According to MS, the macro environment remains in a flux, clouding near-term revenue outlook and it believes that growth should normalise on a two-year basis. The brokerage cautions on FY24 outlook, with the expected stock volatility in the near term. “Would use that as an opportunity to accumulate,” it added.Follow our live blog for all the market actionEarly last week, Jefferies said, “Among companies, consensus revenue growth estimates for CY24 have been lowered for top clients of all IT firms, barring Wipro, with the highest cuts of 80-180bps for HCLT & TechM. Additionally, profitability pressures are visible in CY24 as well, with aggregate margin/PAT estimates for top clients being revised downwards by 30bps/3 percent. Downward revisions in CY24 estimates suggests that concerns are now shifting towards CY24.”The brokerage sees Coforge, Wipro and LTIM at high risk and believes Infosys, TCS, and HCL are better placed. “With sector valuations at 23x, we remain selective, with Infosys our only top pick,” it said.Also read: TCS CEO-designate Krithivasan rules out a great organisational or strategic rebootOn Wipro and LTIM, the brokerage said that while consensus expects limited deceleration in their revenue growth, a larger deceleration in the growth of their top clients is expected. For Coforge, the consensus revenue growth in FY24 is lower than the growth expected for its top clients.“Infosys/TCS appear better placed on this front and the outlook of their clients seems to be improving as well. HCLT also looks well positioned as consensus expects HCLT's clients to see growth acceleration in FY24. TechM's expectations of growth moderation seem to be in sync with those of its clients, suggesting limited risk to FY24 growth,” the brokerage added.Also read: A day of mixed feelings: Gopinathan on resigning from TCS“In our view, the sector’s outlook remains “fluid”, specifically with increased macro “noise” during the past two weeks as well as SVB’s failure, likely causing enterprise clients to procrastinate on IT spending decisions, further delaying CY23’s actual budget cycle, and resulting in longer sale cycles, while also impacting sector’s near-term visibility,” Research and Advisory firm Wedbush said in an industry note.The advisory has made revenue growth adjustments for Accenture, Infosys, and Cognizant and believes the EPS impact will be marginal, given the supply-side tailwinds such as moderating wage inflation, subcontractor use decline and widening pyramid structure.“Accordingly, we are not making any rating changes at this point,” it added.",LTIMindtree Ltd.

"  March 17, 2023 / 01:21 PM IST  ","Macro uncertainties cast shadow on IT services, mixed views on preferred stocks","The IT services sector, which has already been suffering in the past year due to the uncertain global environment, is still not out of the woods as the macro environment continues to be turbulent, with analysts remaining cautious about the sector.The benchmark Nifty IT index has declined 19 percent in the last year, compared to the broader Nifty50 index, which fell around 1 percent.What do brokerages sayAccording to foreign brokerage Nomura, the demand uncertainty is rising and margins have bottomed out, with concerns around uncertain macro conditions, falling attrition and disciplined mergers and acquisitions.The brokerage has a ""buy"" rating on Infosys, Tech Mahindra, Persistent Systems and Coforge. However, it recommends ""reduce"" on Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), LTIMindtree (LTIM) and L&T Technologies.Morgan Stanley (MS), on the other hand, is bullish on LTIM and prefers Infosys and HCL Technologies.According to MS, the macro environment remains in a flux, clouding near-term revenue outlook and it believes that growth should normalise on a two-year basis. The brokerage cautions on FY24 outlook, with the expected stock volatility in the near term. “Would use that as an opportunity to accumulate,” it added.Follow our live blog for all the market actionEarly last week, Jefferies said, “Among companies, consensus revenue growth estimates for CY24 have been lowered for top clients of all IT firms, barring Wipro, with the highest cuts of 80-180bps for HCLT & TechM. Additionally, profitability pressures are visible in CY24 as well, with aggregate margin/PAT estimates for top clients being revised downwards by 30bps/3 percent. Downward revisions in CY24 estimates suggests that concerns are now shifting towards CY24.”The brokerage sees Coforge, Wipro and LTIM at high risk and believes Infosys, TCS, and HCL are better placed. “With sector valuations at 23x, we remain selective, with Infosys our only top pick,” it said.Also read: TCS CEO-designate Krithivasan rules out a great organisational or strategic rebootOn Wipro and LTIM, the brokerage said that while consensus expects limited deceleration in their revenue growth, a larger deceleration in the growth of their top clients is expected. For Coforge, the consensus revenue growth in FY24 is lower than the growth expected for its top clients.“Infosys/TCS appear better placed on this front and the outlook of their clients seems to be improving as well. HCLT also looks well positioned as consensus expects HCLT's clients to see growth acceleration in FY24. TechM's expectations of growth moderation seem to be in sync with those of its clients, suggesting limited risk to FY24 growth,” the brokerage added.Also read: A day of mixed feelings: Gopinathan on resigning from TCS“In our view, the sector’s outlook remains “fluid”, specifically with increased macro “noise” during the past two weeks as well as SVB’s failure, likely causing enterprise clients to procrastinate on IT spending decisions, further delaying CY23’s actual budget cycle, and resulting in longer sale cycles, while also impacting sector’s near-term visibility,” Research and Advisory firm Wedbush said in an industry note.The advisory has made revenue growth adjustments for Accenture, Infosys, and Cognizant and believes the EPS impact will be marginal, given the supply-side tailwinds such as moderating wage inflation, subcontractor use decline and widening pyramid structure.“Accordingly, we are not making any rating changes at this point,” it added.",Tech Mahindra Ltd.

(ZEEL) on March 16 slammed the report saying that the company is set to repay $10 million to IndusInd Bank to wrap Sony deal and called it 'speculative'.Issuing a clarification to the stock exchanges, the media company said that it is exploring several strategies, including settlement, in relation to the ongoing dispute mentioned in the news report.Also Read | Zee Entertainment agrees to pay IndusInd Bank dues; lender likely to withdraw insolvency caseHowever, it added, ""there is no clarity at this stage as to which resolution or strategy the Company will finally pursue, much less the timing of any such strategy. Accordingly, we believe that the news report is speculative in nature.""At 10 am, the stock was quoting at Rs 200.65 on the NSE, lower by 2.93 percent from the previous close. The stock soared 9 percent during late trading hours of March 16 when the Bloomberg report was published. The stock is down 18 percent for 2023 so far.IndusInd Bank approached the bankruptcy court in February to initiate insolvency proceedings against ZEEL, a move that could have threatened the merger by stopping all transactions, including asset transfers.The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) provided interim relief by deciding to stay the proceedings. The next hearing will be held on March 29.Meanwhile, analysts are awaiting details on the merger progress. ""We believe expedition on the settlement will work favourably for the Zee Sony merger as valuations are compelling in the range of 7-10x forward price-to-earnings ratio for the merged entity,"" said Karan Taurani of Elara Capital.Ashwin Patil, senior research analyst at LKP Securities said, ""NCLT approval shall be the final step towards completion of the merger. It will be immensely positive for the stock.""",Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd.
