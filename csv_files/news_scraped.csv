JM Financial has maintained a hold rating and expects its target price to Rs 2270 a share, down 12 percent from the previous target price. Nuvama has maintained its buy rating on the stock.According to Bloomberg, IndiGo currently has 20 buy ratings, 2 hold ratings, and 2 sell ratings.Industry experts predict that the aviation sector will become more competitive in the wake of recent developments. SpiceJet has received a financial boost of Rs 500 crore from its promoters, while Go First has been granted conditional approval to resume operations after being grounded. Furthermore, Jet Airways has received the necessary Indian air operator permit from DGCA. All of these factors are contributing to the increased competition in the industry.However, it's worth noting that Rakesh Gangwal's impending stake sale is likely to continue exerting pressure on the stock's performance, analysts added.IndiGo is actively pursuing an expansion of its international footprint by forming strategic partnerships, such as the codeshare agreement with Turkish Airlines, and enhancing loyalty programs. The company's robust order book positions it favourably to further expand its network within the domestic market.However, analysts highlight that IndiGo's few aircraft, around 40 are already grounded due to engine failures, as Pratt & Whitney (P&W) has recalled its engines for testing purposes. As a result, some of its planes will be grounded in phases. Last month, P&W decided to inspect around 1200 engines for certain defects.""Despite the positive outlook and strong current demand in India's aviation industry, we still see several challenges to be addressed, making it not yet a perfect picture for IndiGo. We value the stock at 8x FY25E EV/EBITDAR to arrive at our TP of INR2,630. We reiterate our Neutral rating due to the above reasons"", said Motilal Oswal in its latest note.IndiGo reported its best-ever quarterly net profit of Rs 3,091 crore for the June quarter, driven by record airfares, strong demand, lower fuel prices, and favorable forex movements. This profit surpasses its cumulative annual profit since its inception 17 years ago. The company's revenue also saw a significant 30 percent year-on-year increase, reaching Rs 16,683 crore.During the quarter, IndiGo served a record 26.2 million customers, including 300,000 passengers on a single day in May, marking a 30 percent YoY rise.

The brokerage said L&T and Maruti were also included in the global emerging markets (GEM) focus list.The brokerage said it is bullish on India's financial sector and is increasing its 'overweight' position on industrials while reducing its 'overweight' stance on IT.The brokerage says Maruti Suzuki is poised to benefit from rising per-capita income in India, alongside market share growth and an improved product mix. The company's strong track record of successful new models and expanded price ranges, especially focusing on SUVs, is expected to drive further market share expansion. It foresees margin expansion to approximately 9 percent by F2025, driven by leverage gains, a new SUV-focused model cycle, and the gradual pass-through of commodity headwinds.Maruti's alliance with Suzuki-Toyota positions it favourably for the future of the automotive industry (Autos 2.0). Despite fair valuations, there is potential for the company's multiple to expand, considering the anticipated improvement in auto volumes, margins, and market share.Also Read: India at the start of 'long wave boom', China's may be ending soon: Morgan StanleyIndia's per capita GDP stands at only $2500, significantly lower than China's $12,700. However, despite the lower income level, India exhibits positive demographic trends, which positions the country to potentially embark on a prolonged wave of economic growth. This comes at a time when China may be experiencing a slowdown, Morgan said in its note.A notable contrast between the two countries is the level of household debt relative to GDP. In India, household debt/GDP is only 19 percent, while in China, it is much higher at 48 percent. Moreover, life insurance penetration in India is comparatively low, with only 2 percent of Indian households having life insurance coverage.Morgan expects Larsen & Toubro to be a leading beneficiary of the Indian and broader EM capex cycle. The brokerage says L&T enjoys domestic macro tailwinds and strong infrastructure prospects in the Middle East, particularly Saudi Arabia.L&T stands out with its economies of scale, impressive order inflow growth, diversified order book, improved execution, and lower margin volatility. Despite its core valuations trading near the long-term average, it remains an attractive choice compared to its EPC peers, which are trading at a 20 percent premium to long-term averages.Morgan Stanley foresees a profit cycle that is halfway through its course, as profit share in GDP has increased from 2 percent in 2020 to approximately 4 percent and is expected to reach 8 percent in the next four to five years. This indicates a 10 percent nominal GDP and about 20 percent compound growth in headline earnings.The forecast is supported by the initiation of a new private capex cycle, which complements the ongoing government capex cycle. These factors underscore the promising outlook for economic growth and earnings expansion in the foreseeable future.Morgan Stanley remains optimistic about India due to its favourable fundamentals and reduced valuation premiums compared to other Emerging Markets (EM). The country is now designated as the core 'overweight' market within the Asia Pacific ex-Japan and EM category. The market is willing to pay a premium for India's growth opportunities, with the 12-month P/E and trailing P/B ratios standing above historical averages.",Maruti Suzuki India Ltd.

"  August 03, 2023 / 08:56 AM IST  ","Buy Maruti Suzuki; target of Rs 11,100: Prabhudas Lilladher","Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Maruti SuzukiMaruti Suzuki (MSIL)’s 1QFY24 revenues were marginally higher than our (c1%) and consesnus estimates (c2%), however, higher employee costs and other other expenses led to a miss on EBITDA margins (10% vs BBGe: 10.2%; PLe: 10.5%) (which could not be offset by higher gross margin). EBITDA margins expanded by c280bp YoY, but was lower QoQ on lower volumes, higher employee and ooperating expenses. Chip shortage impacted 28k units and MSIL noted that situation is largely normalised now. Going ahead, MSIL hopes to outgrow PV industry’s growth led by its SUV portfolio, increased traction from CNG models and servicing stronger orderbook. We expect MISL to partially re-coup lost market share through faster growth than the industry in UV & MUV segment (for MSIL we build its UV & MUV mix to increase to ~30% in FY24 vs ~21% in FY23). MSIL is well placed to strongly benefit from (1) market share gains and ASP increase coming from higer mix of the new UV portfolio, (2) c260bps increase (over FY23-25E) in EBITDA margins on the back of commodity cost softening, cost control, operating leverage and higher UV share and (3) rural revival.OutlookWe marginally change our EPS estimates for FY24E by -1.5%, given largely inline numbers and reiterate ‘BUY’ with an unchanged TP of Rs 11,100 at 25x Mar-25E EPS.For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Adjusted PAT of Rs. 790 crore (up 23% q-o-q) was 5% above estimate on higher other income and lower interest cost. Dahej terminal’s utilisation improved 97% in Q1FY24 (versus 77% in Q4FY23) with re-gas volume of 217 tbtu (up 11%/27% y-o-y/q-o-q) while Kochi terminal’s utilization was flat q-o-q at 20%. Fall in spot LNG price bodes well for sustained strong volume recovery in the coming quarters. Dahej capacity expansion to 22.5 mtpa remains on track. We expect a healthy PAT CAGR of 14% over FY23-25E along with strong RoE of 22%.OutlookWe maintain our Buy rating on P-LNG with an unchanged PT of Rs. 265. The valuation of 9.8x/8.4x its FY2024E/FY2025E EPS is attractive considering earnings growth visibility and stock offers healthy dividend yield of 4-5%.For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

"  August 03, 2023 / 09:03 AM IST  ",Hold Petronet LNG; target of Rs 235: ICICI Securities,"ICICI Securities research report on Petronet LNGPetronet LNG (PLNG) has reported a steady 11% YoY improvement in EBITDA to INR 11.8bn and a 13% YoY rise in PAT to INR 7.9bn, up 25/29% QoQ, in line with I-Sec estimates. Dahej (in Gujarat) volumes of 217tbtu improved materially, rising 11/26% YoY/QoQ, respectively, while Kochi (in Kerala) volumes of 13tbtu rose 8% YoY, flat QoQ. Expansion plans for Dahej to enhance capacity to 22.5mtpa by FY26E remain on track and the company is progressing on its INR 140bn petrochemical plant as well. Muted valuations, sharp moderation in spot LNG prices and our sense that global LNG supplies can steadily improve over the next 2-3 years, lead us to believe operational prospects can be brighter over FY24E-FY25E. However, concerns on capital allocation remain unresolved and we continue to be sceptical of the company’s plan to invest INR140bn150bn in an unrelated business line (petchem). Reiterate HOLD.OutlookWe value PLNG as per the DCF methodology, using a WACC of 12%, DER of 15%, long-term Dahej utilisation assumption of 100% and terminal growth rate of 4.0%.

However, adjusted EBITDA was 4% above our estimate, led by an 186 bps beat in EBITA margin at 17.8% (down 389 bps y-o-y) given strong seeds margin and better product mix. CPC business’ performance were hit by a steep 17%/10% y-o-y decline in volume/pricing, which led to steep revenues de-growth across geographies. UPL SAS was impacted by delayed sowing/price pressures, while seeds business posted strong performance with 26%/54% y-o-y jump in revenue/EBITDA. Management cut FY24 revenue/EBITDA growth guidance to 1-5%/3-7% from earlier guidance of 6-10%/8-12%. The new guidance would be dependent upon a recovery in H2FY24. We thus cut our FY24/FY25 earnings estimate by 6%/7%.OutlookAlthough near term challenges persists for agro-chem players but the steep fall in UPL’s stock price largely factors in concerns and valuation of 10.5x/8.4x FY24E/FY25E EPS seems attractive.
