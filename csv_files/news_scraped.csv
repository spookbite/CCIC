"  July 21, 2023 / 05:25 PM IST  ",Ashok Leyland Q1 net profit soars 747% YoY to Rs 576 crore,"Commercial vehicles (CV) maker Ashok Leyland on July 21 reported a 747 percent year-on-year (YoY) jump in its standalone net profit for the quarter ended June to Rs 576.42 crore, aided by a deferred tax credit, higher volumes, softening commodity prices, and cost cuts. During the same period last year, the flagship company of the Hinduja group posted a net profit of Rs 68.05 crore.Shenu Agarwal, MD and CEO, Ashok Leyland, said, “We have expanded our bottom line on the back of market penetration driven by efficient products and network (distribution) expansion, along with cost control.

We have seen sector and stock rotation in the last several weeks including banks, technology, engineering, oil & gas and FMCG stocks which have driven this stellar rally of around 3,000 points from March lows.The Nifty50 has formed a long bullish candlestick pattern on the daily, weekly as well as monthly charts. We have been seeing higher highs, higher lows for the fourth consecutive month.Further, the Nifty has been consistently respecting the support level of the 13-day EMA (exponential moving average) since April 2023 indicating strong strength of the primary bullish trend.

Returns are based on the July 20 closing prices:Expert: Viraj Vyas, CMT, technical & derivatives analyst - institutional equity at Ashika Stock BrokingGlenmark Pharma: Buy | LTP: Rs 740 | Stop-Loss: Rs 710 | Target: Rs 830 | Return: 12 percentThe stock has undergone a robust base formation since its decline in 2018, and recently, it achieved a breakout above the 2018 high. This breakout is noteworthy as 2018 marked the top for mid and small stocks, and historically, breaking above 2018 highs has often led to substantial moves of around 10-15 percent in stocks.Considering the strong base formation and impressive price action after the breakout, the stock appears to be a compelling choice in the pharma sector.Federal Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 137 | Stop-Loss: Rs 132 | Target: Rs 160 | Return: 17 percentThe stock exhibited a robust rally from May to November 2022, spanning approximately 30 weeks, followed by a period of sideways trading. During this phase, the stock formed lower highs while finding consistent support in the Rs 125 - 120 zone, resembling a Descending Triangle pattern.The consolidation phase also lasted around 30 weeks, and currently, the stock is showing signs of a potential breakout, supported by above-average volume participation.Ashok Leyland: Buy | LTP: Rs 175.7 | Stop-Loss: Rs 165 | Target: Rs 200 | Return: 14 percentSince 2018, the stock has gone through a tumultuous journey, witnessing significant fluctuations in its price. In September 2022, the stock revisited its all-time high level, and rather than facing a substantial pullback, it displayed a shallow retracement before ultimately surpassing the crucial Rs 167 mark in July 2023.This breakout above the 2018 highs, combined with the stock's massive base breakout, presents a highly enticing opportunity for investors, making it an appealing choice for a lucrative buy.The underlying bullish momentum and positive price action further reinforce the potential for this stock's upward trajectory.Expert: Pravesh Gour, senior technical analyst at Swastika InvestmartJupiter Wagons: Buy | LTP: Rs 197 | Stop-Loss: Rs 180 | Target: Rs 224 | Return: 14 percentThere is a classical bullish setup as the counter has witnessed a breakout of Bullish Flag formation with strong volume.

The breakout coincides with rising volume and it manages to sustain above the breakout level.It is trading above its all-important moving averages with a positive bias in momentum indicators. On the downside, Rs 385 will act as a strong support level.Linde India: Buy | LTP: Rs 4,594 | Stop-Loss: Rs 4,350 | Target: Rs 5,144 | Return: 12 percentThe counter is trying to come out of a long consolidation with strong volume and witnessed a breakout of the triangle pattern. The overall structure of the counter is very Classical on the daily chart. The pattern suggests an immediate target of Rs 5000, while it has the potential to move further upside to Rs 5,144 level.On the downside, Rs 4,350 will act as an immediate support level. MACD (moving average convergence divergence) is supporting the current strength whereas the momentum indicator RSI (relative strength index) is also positively poised.Expert: Mitesh Karwa, research analyst at Bonanza PortfolioState Bank of India: Buy | LTP: Rs 610 | Stop-Loss: Rs 580 | Target: Rs 657 | Return: 8 percentState Bank of India has seen breaking out of a Cup and Handle pattern on the weekly timeframe with a bullish candlestick and closing above the highs of the last six months with above-average volumes which indicates bullish strength.On the indicator front, the momentum oscillator RSI (relative strength index 14) is at around 67 on the daily time frame indicating strength by sustaining above 50. Ichimoku Cloud is also suggesting a bullish move as the price is trading above the conversion line, baseline and cloud on the daily timeframe.Observation of the above factors indicates that a bullish move in SBI is possible for a target of up to Rs 657 in 3-4 weeks. One can initiate a buy trade in the range of Rs 606-610 with a stop-loss of Rs 580 on a daily closing basis.Asahi India Glass: Buy | LTP: Rs 558.65 | Stop-Loss: Rs 496 | Target: Rs 650 | Return: 16 percentAsahi India Glass has seen giving a false breakdown on the weekly timeframe and closing with a bullish candlestick above the highs of the last six months and closing above all its important EMAs which indicates bullish strength.On the indicator front, the momentum oscillator RSI (14) is at around 70 showing strength by sustaining above 50. The Supertrend indicator is indicating a bullish continuation and the Ichimoku Cloud is also indicating strength as the price is trading above the conversion line and baseline.Observation of the above factors indicates that a bullish move in Asahi India Glass is possible for a target of up to Rs 650. One can initiate a buy trade in between the range of Rs 554-558, with a stop-loss of Rs 496 on a daily closing basis.Expert: Vidnyan Sawant, AVP - technical research at GEPL CapitalHDFC Asset Management Company: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,520 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,350 | Target: Rs 2,950 | Return: 17 percentHDFC AMC stock, after experiencing a correction since December 2019, has established a solid support base ranging from Rs 1,610 on the lower side to Rs 2,250 on the higher side.Recently, the stock broke out of the Double Bottom pattern, indicating the beginning of an upward trend.On the daily timeframe, HDFC AMC stock is currently trading above important moving averages, specifically the 50-day and 200-day exponential moving averages (EMA). This confirms the presence of an uptrend in the stock's price.Moreover, the relative strength index (RSI) on the weekly timeframe is showing positive momentum, as it has risen and sustained well above the 60 mark.Based on our analysis, we anticipate that the prices of HDFC AMC will continue to rise towards Rs 2,950 level. It is crucial to strictly maintain a stop-loss at Rs 2,350, based on the closing prices.Century Textiles and Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 971.75 | Stop-Loss: Rs 900 | Target: Rs 1,120 | Return: 15 percentCentury Textiles stock is currently demonstrating strong momentum as it is approaching record highs. In addition, a breakout of the bearish channel on the weekly timeframe in late June 2023 suggests a continuation of the upward trend.Furthermore, the RSI has shown a breakout, indicating increasing momentum in the stock's price. Given these compelling factors, it can be inferred that Century Textiles stock is displaying robust performance.Looking ahead, we anticipate the prices to climb towards Rs 1,120 level. It is recommended to set a stop-loss at Rs 900 based on closing prices to effectively manage potential downside risks.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

"  July 21, 2023 / 02:14 PM IST  ",IT stocks spiral lower as Infosys sours sentiment,"Information technology stocks were the biggest drags on the market on July 21 after a raft of disappointing numbers from Infosys and other players highlighted the stiff near-term challenges confronting the IT segment.Infosys plummeted 10 percent in early trade after India’s second-largest IT services firm not only missed earnings estimates but also slashed its revenue growth guidance for the current fiscal to 1-3.5 percent from 4-7 percent.It cited a challenging macroeconomic environment as the reason behind the cut in guidance.Follow our live blog for all the market actionThe financialsThe company reported an 11 percent YoY increase in its net profit to Rs 5,945 crore, while revenue climbed 10 percent to Rs 37,933 crore. Operating margin came in at 20.8 percent, down from last quarter’s 21 percent.Salil Parekh, CEO and MD of Infosys, said the company is seeing clients either stopping or slowing down transformation programmes and discretionary programmes, particular in financial services, mortgages, hi-tech, telecom, and retail.Also Read: Infosys nosedives 10% on sharp guidance cut; fuels brokerage downgradesAnalysts' viewsHe added that deal signings and start dates have been delayed, and a lot of the revenue from the larger and mega deals will be seen only towards the later part of the financial year. A combination of both is why, Parekh said, the company slashed its revenue guidance for the year.Macquarie downgraded the stock to 'underperform' as it was disappointed by the IT behemoth's deal wins in Q1. The foreign brokerage was also skeptical of Infosys winning a fair share of outcome-oriented managed services deals in the coming quarters.Nomura was another brokerage that downgraded Infosys to 'reduce' along with a cut of nearly 1 percent in its target price for the stock to Rs 1,210.JPMorgan, on the other hand, said the sharp guidance cut brings a welcome dose of realism, which should be extended to the valuation of Infosys. The firm expects the miss on net profit and guidance cut to have a bearing on the valuation of Infosys in the short-to-medium term.IT sector bellwether TCS dropped nearly 2 percent to Rs 3,393.50, while Wipro was trading with cuts of 2.40 percent at Rs 407.30 in afternoon trade.Last week, TCS reported a 16.8 percent increase in net profit on a year-on-year (YoY) basis in the quarter ended June 30, 2023, driven by a strong growth in total contract value (TCV) deal wins despite a tough business environment.Consolidated revenue for the quarter came in at Rs 59,381 crore, marking an on-year rise of 13 percent. In constant currency terms, the revenue grew by 7 percent YoY.The numbers were in line with the muted estimates. Sequentially, the country's largest software services exporter grew by a modest 0.4 percent, which is its slowest growth in the last 12 quarters. The net profit declined by 3 percent as against the March quarter.Wipro had reported an 11.9 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in net profit in the first quarter at Rs 2,870 crore. Sequentially, however, net profit was down by 6.6 percent due to decline in all major financial metrics.Revenue for the quarter grew 6 percent YoY at Rs 22,831 crore as compared to Rs 21,528 crore in Q1FY23, missing estimates of Rs Rs 23,014 crore.Mid-Sized PackThe weak operating environment has weighed on mid-sized IT firms as well.Mphasis shares slipped nearly 1 percent in early trade after the company’s revenue fell 4.6 percent YoY to Rs 3,252 crore in the quarter ended June, while net profit declined 1.2 percent to Rs 396 crore from Rs 401 crore in Q1 FY23.The firm said there was a short-term impact on performance due to weakness in banking sector as well as pressure on discretionary spends.Persistent Systems tumbled more than 4 percent after the Pune-based IT company reported a 9-percent sequential fall in net profit at Rs 228.8 crore for the quarter ended June.At 11.45 am, the stock was quoting at Rs 4,832.85, down 4.16 percent from the previous close. Trading volumes at 4 lakh shares were slightly above the 1-month average volumes.Persistent Systems' revenue in rupee terms grew by 3 percent QoQ to Rs 2,321.2 crore and topline in dollar terms also increased by 3 percent to $282.90 million for the quarter. Both the topline and bottomline numbers missed Street estimates.The EBIT or operating margin declined to 14.9 percent in Q1, missing estimates of flat margins of 15.4 percent reported last quarter. Persistent had earlier said that it expects to improve margins by 200-300 basis points over the next two-three years.Similarly, Coforge shares dropped 2 percent after the IT firm’s revenue increased 2.4 percent sequentially for the April-June quarter to USD 271.8 million. Coforge saw its revenue grow 2.7 percent in constant currency terms, lower than the expected 3.5 percent sequential growth.The mid-cap IT services player, however, reported a 43.9-percent jump in its net profit to Rs 165.3 crore, as the company had to provide for an exceptional expense of Rs 52.3 crore in the March quarter.The company also saw a miss on its operating margins, as it was down 400bps primarily on account of a pickup in hiring, salary hikes, bonus payouts, and visa costs.As per analysts, the key stumbling block for the entire sector currently is the recessionary headwinds in Europe and US – the bread-and-butter markets for domestic IT players.“We expect macro-related uncertainty, likely slowdown in tech spends and supply-side pressure to impede growth in the near-term at least in 2 more quarters,” brokerage Ashika said in a recent note.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

The disappointing June quarter results posted by the IT behemoth, which has a 6.9 percent weightage on the Nifty 50, dragged the index down on July 21.At 12:30 pm, Infosys was quoting at Rs 1,331 on the NSE, lower by 8 percent from its previous close. The stock tumbled below the crucial 200-day moving average.Infosys' Q1 report card not only wiped out all the gains made by the stock in a month but also made analysts wary of its future prospects. As the management cut revenue growth guidance from 4-7 percent to 1-3.5 percent, 'Buy' calls from analysts on the stock tumbled from 28 to 21 overnight.The 12-month consensus target on the stock, as per Bloomberg, is now 2 percent lower than what it was a day back. If we look at the number of downgrades over the past year, the picture is even gloomier.In fact, the 12-month target for the stock was Rs 1,813 a year back. Currently, it is Rs 1,313, which shows how analysts were way off with their estimates, not having anticipated the kind of slowdown witnessed in discretionary IT spending.Also Read: Infosys nosedives 10% on sharp guidance cutOf the recent lot, Macquarie and Nomura have downgraded their ratings on the stock.Macquarie downgraded the stock to 'underperform' as it was disappointed by the IT behemoth's deal wins in Q1. The brokerage does not see the $2 billion AI deal as a 'mega deal' as it is just an estimate by the management.On the other hand, Nomura has downgraded Infosys to 'reduce' along with a cut in target price to Rs 1,210, which is another 9 percent downside from here. The broking firm has also reduced FY24-25 EPS (earnings per share) estimates for Infosys by 3-4 percent to factor in the weak Q1 earnings.According to Bloomberg, Infosys' EPS for Q1 FY24 came in at Rs 14.37 versus estimates of Rs 15. For the forthcoming quarters, EPS is estimated at Rs 15.5, Rs 15.7 and Rs 16.3. For FY24, the EPS estimate of Rs 61.6, has been revised to 3.2 percent down in a day.Management commentaryInfosys top boss Salil Parekh said that in the near term they see clients stopping or slowing down transformation programs and discretionary works — particularly in financial services in mortgages, asset management, investment banking and payments, and in telecom. “We also see some impact in the hi-tech industry and in parts of retail,” he said.Also Read: Delays in decision-making, clients cutting back on spends: Why Infosys sees a bleak year aheadIn the meeting with analysts, Chief Financial Officer Nilanjan Roy said the decline in guidance, among other reasons was due to lower-than-expected volumes and lower mega deals in discretionary areas.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.
