"  June 08, 2023 / 06:46 AM IST  ",Cheap Russian crude imports turn not so profitable for Indian oil companies,"India managed to reduce its overall expenditure on crude oil imports by taking advantage of discounted Russian oil. However, Indian Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) failed to maximise the benefits from this favorable situation. Kotak Institutional Equities in a report said that, “We also note that while India’s overall crude imports costs have benefitted from Russian imports, OMCs’ reported raw material costs do not show any increased advantage versus Dubai crude.”Kotak Institutional Equities say that the benefit of Russian crude will be higher for companies like Nayara Energy, which is owned by Rosneft, a Russian OMC. Indian oil companies have to spend more on transportation and insurance costs as compared to Nayara Energy which saves cost and benefits from the discounted Russian crude oil.Indian Oil Corporation’s (IOC) raw material costs in Q2FY23 was around $115 per barrel, while Dubai crude oil was around $105 per barrel. This means IOC was not able to monetise the benefits of Russian imports.Similarly, Bharat Petroleum Corporation’s (BPCL) raw material costs in Q2FY23 was around $115 per barrel compared to Dubai crude oil, which was around $105 per barrel.Dubai crude is used as a benchmark. Thus, if Indian refiners’ crude costs decline (versus Dubai crude), it not only boosts their refining GRMs, but also offers improved advantage over Singapore GRM.Also Read: Oil India, ONGC gain as crude prices rally on Saudi plan to cut productionBetter Gross Refining Margins (GRM)Indian OMCs have reported strong GRMs as compared to the Singapore GRM complex margin. For FY23, IOC reported GRM of $19.5 per barrel, which was nearly two times of Singapore GRM complex margin of $10.8 per barrel. BPCL’s GRM was $20.2 billion per barrel.IOC and BPCL have reported a strong GRM compared to large independent refiners like Reliance Industries Limited, Chennai Petroleum Corporation, and Mangalore Refineries and Petrochemical Limited. The report said, ”In recent quarters, the gap with other refiners has increased as OMCs (surprisingly in our view) have not reported the GRM after the impact of windfall export taxes on retail fuels (diesel/petrol/ATF) that was implemented from July 1, 2022.”After the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, and sanctions on Russian crudes by several countries, India has emerged as a key buyer of Russian crude. From barely 1-2 percent of crude imports, share of Russian imports gradually increased in FY2023 to 21.5 percent. Russia is followed by Iraq (21.4 percent) and Saudi Arabia (16.7 percent), said the report.Analysts's viewsKotak Institutional Equities has put a sell rating on HPCL at a target price of Rs 257 and reduce the rating on IOCL and BPCL at Rs 89 and Rs 357 respectively. The institutional research firm will re-rate the Indian OMCs only if they continue their strong refining performance post the 2024 general elections, when OMCs will have greater control on the pump prices.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

"  June 08, 2023 / 10:22 AM IST  ","HDFC Securities downgrades Hero MotoCorp to reduce, cuts target price to Rs 2,512","Brokerage firm HDFC Securities has downgraded Hero MotoCorp Ltd (HMC) to 'reduce' from 'buy' and revised its target price down to Rs 2,512.Hero MotoCorp's market share is likely to decline further due to the introduction of Honda Motor and Scooter's (HMSI) 100cc motorcycle in the entry-level segment. HDFC Securities attributes this potential decline to the competitive pricing strategy of HMSI, which has launched Shine 100cc at a price of Rs 64,900. The launch of Shine 100cc demonstrates HMSI's strong commitment to establishing a foothold in this segment by leveraging the well-established 'Shine' brand in the 125cc segment and targeting sales of 300,000 units in the first year.As per HDFC Securities, if HMSI effectively executes its plans, their entry into the 100cc segment could pose a serious threat to Hero MotoCorp.HMC faces challenges as the market demand for motorcycles gradually shifts to 125cc from the 100cc segment, which has been the company's main strength.   This shift in the mix does not bode well for HMC as the company heavily relies on the 100cc segment, which accounts for 78 percent of its sales volumes and where Hero MotoCorp enjoys an 80 percent market share.However, the company has experienced a significant decline in its market share in the 125cc segment, dropping from a peak of 55 percent in FY19 to just 21 percent. Despite efforts, HMC has been unable to regain its lost market share in this segment in recent times, HDFC Securities report said.""HMC has a healthy launch pipeline for FY24, with the bulk of its launches likely to be in the 125cc and above segments, where it is trying to revive its share. However, we do not expect it to recover a meaningful share in these segments, given its multiple failed attempts in the past and significant competition in these segments,"" HDFC Securities said in its recent note.Given these headwinds, the brokerage house has cut its earnings by 5 percent for FY24 and 15 percent for FY25. ""We expect HMC to post 11% EPS CAGR over FY23-25, largely revenue led, as any benefit from softening input costs is likely to be ploughed back to recover back lost share. Since we expect HMC to further lose share over FY23-25, we lower our target multiple to 14x from 15x, to arrive at our revised TP of Rs2,512 per share,"" the HDFC Securities report said.",Hero MotoCorp Ltd.

"  June 08, 2023 / 02:25 PM IST  ",Buy Tata Motors; target of Rs 650: Motilal Oswal,"Motilal Oswal's research report on Tata MotorsTTMT’s India Investor Day 2023 highlighted its focus on a) customer-centric innovations in both businesses, b) profitable growth by leading from the front, and c) consistent delivery on financial targets. Here are the key takeaways from the meetings: Most of the leading indicators, such as customer surveys and transporter confidence index (except ICV and LCV), seem positive. TTMT expects a single-digit growth rate for the CV industry in FY24. It is yet to see any benefits from the implementation of the voluntary scrappage policy from Apr’23. Usually, CV demand is good in a pre-general election year due to election spending, and it moderates after the elections. The company’s focus on discount moderation is paying off, and it wants to cut discounts to below 10%. It has not increased ex-showroom prices since Sep’22; however, a reduction in discounts helped improve realizations. TTMT is driving electrification in CVs to lead the EV transition by delivering comprehensive EV solutions customized to address intended application requirements. For each of its EV products, it has an anchor customer in place. It has entered into a JV with Cummins for all future zero-emission technologies, including BEV, Hydrogen ICE and Hydrogen Fuel Cell.OutlookThe stock trades at 19.2x/16.7x FY24E/FY25E consolidate P/E and 4.9x/4.2x EV/EBITDA.

"  June 08, 2023 / 11:18 AM IST  ",Buy Tata Motors; target of Rs 605: Prabhudas Lilladher,"Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Tata MotorsWe attended Tata Motors’ India Investor Day and came out positive on Tata Motors India strategy. Management highlighted continued growth in the CV and PV segment but with moderation in the growth rate. M&HCV demand outlook is strong and TTMT is confident of maintaining its lead in SUVs. We liked the strong focus on the margins across division to grow in a profitable manner by disrupting standard industry practices in the CV segment. EVs have become a big focus point for TTMT with a separate session being planned for highlighting increased awareness within the company related to climate change and holistic measures being adopted by the company to become net zero by 2040 in PV and 2045 in CV division. We remain positive on TTMT given (1) JLR’s volume ramp-up resulting in strong revenue, profitability and FCF (aided by high order book), 2) CV segment (on domestic side) benefitting from ongoing upcycle, operating leverage and tailwinds from lower commodity costs & lower discounting and (3) strong market share in PV segment (13.5% vs 8% in FY21) led by revamped portfolio, rising SUV share and rising EV penetration.OutlookWe expect revenue/EBITDA CAGR of 12%/32% over FY24/25E. We have a ‘BUY’ rating with SoTP based TP of Rs 605 (Mar-25).For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.
