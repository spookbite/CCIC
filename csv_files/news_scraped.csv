Adjusted EBITDA margin in Q3FY23 improved 10 bps to 18.5%. The margins for the quarter saw an impact of forex loss of 70 bps, which almost nullified tailwinds from INR depreciation for the quarter. The company had a robust order intake of $345 million, fourth consecutive quarter of order intake of over $300 million. The company signed five large deals signed during the quarter (including one over $50 million TCV deal). The Management has upped its FY23 annual revenue growth guidance to 22% in cc and reaffirmed its adjusted EBITDA annual margin guidance at 18.5-19%. The management stated that across the verticals of Banking and Financial Services (BFS) and Insurance client spending are largely still strong. The company is seeing a rebound in its travel, transportation, and hospitality vertical, which has picked up pace post-pandemic.OutlookWe expect the outlook for FY24 to be uncertain on account of global headwinds and any recovery is most likely to be gradual. Coforge on the back of consistent deal wins and healthy order backlog provides decent revenue visibility (FY23 guidance raised in Q3FY23).Hence we maintain Buy rating on Coforge with revised PT of 4900. ( to reflect the rollover of target multiple to FY25E EPS).At the CMP, the stock trades at 25.8x/21.9x its FY24E/FY25E EPS respectively.For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Reported revenue stood at USD251.7m (up 1.9% QoQ/13.6% YoY). Growth was led by the TTH segment, up 1.9% QoQ, while BFSI remained flat and Insurance declined 2.9% QoQ. The company reported order intake of USD345m (the highest ever), up 13.4% QoQ with a 12-month executable order rising 5.0% QoQ to USD841m. EBITDA margin (pre-RSU) of 18.5% (up 10bp QoQ) significantly missed our estimated improvement of 110 bp QoQ. Q3 performance was adversely affected by seasonality and higher furloughs impact in the Insurance and mortgage (BFS) segments. However, the demand environment remained strong, evidenced by robust order booking, which is expected to support the growth momentum in FY24. The building optimism around strong demand and revenue visibility instill confidence and the management raises the earlier guidance of 20%+ YoY CC to 22% YoY CC growth. The raise implies ~3.5% QoQ CC growth in Q4, which we believe is achievable.OutlookWe believe the robust outlook is already factored into the price and we do not see any potential upside from here on.

Returns are based on the January 20 closing prices:Expert: Subash Gangadharan, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at HDFC SecuritiesDabur India: Buy | LTP: Rs 566 | Stop-Loss: Rs 550 | Target: Rs 590 | Return: 4 percentDabur has corrected from a high of Rs 611 touched in December 2022. The stock recently found support around Rs 538 level in January 2023. This is close to the previous intermediate lows, indicating a double bottom formation. The stock has subsequently bounced back and made a higher bottom in the last few sessions.In the process, the stock broke out of a trading range on the back of healthy volumes, which is encouraging. Momentum readings like the 14-day RSI (relative strength index) too have bounced back and are in rising mode now.With the intermediate technical setup too looking positive, we believe the stock has the potential to move higher in the coming weeks. We recommend a buy between Rs 564-568 levels, with a stop-loss at Rs 550 and target of Rs 590.GAIL India: buy | LTP: Rs 99 | Stop-Loss: Rs 96 | Target: Rs 105 | Return: 6 percentAfter correcting from a high of Rs 109 tested in April 2022, GAIL found support around Rs 83 level in September 2022. These are strong supports as they also roughly coincide with previous intermediate lows.The stock has since then been climbing higher and making higher bottoms in the process. This week, the stock also broke out of its recent trading range on the back of above average volumes, indicating it is set to move higher in the coming weeks.Technical indicators are giving positive signals as the stock is trading above the 20 and 50-day SMA (simple moving average). Momentum readings like the 14-week RSI too are in rising mode and not overbought, which implies potential for further upsides.With the intermediate technical setup too looking attractive, we expect the stock to move up towards its previous intermediate highs in the coming weeks. Buy between Rs 97-101 levels, with a stop-loss at Rs 96 and target of Rs 105.Bajaj Finance: Sell | LTP: Rs 5,860 | Stop-Loss: Rs 6,075 | Target: Rs 5,460 | Return: 7 percentBajaj Finance is in a short term downtrend as it has been making lower tops and lower bottoms for the last several weeks. Recently, the stock broke down below its recent supports after reacting from close to its 50-day SMA. This indicates that the downtrend looks set to continue.Technical indicators are giving negative signals as the stock is now trading below the 20 day and 50 day SMA. Momentum readings like the 14-week RSI are in decline mode and not oversold, which implies potential for more downsides.We therefore expect the stock to correct further in the coming sessions. Sell between Rs 5,855-5,865 levels, with a stop-loss at Rs 6,075 and downside target of Rs 5,460.Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak SecuritiesDivis Laboratories: Sell | LTP: Rs 3,343 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,430 | Target: Rs 3,100 | Return: 7 percentThe stock was forming a rising leg bearish consolidation and the support was at Rs 3,350. On Friday, the stock closed below the level of Rs 3,350.Based on the charts, the stock is heading towards the next supports, which are at Rs 3,250 and Rs 3,100.

Sell at Rs 3,350-3,400, with a stop-loss of Rs 3,430.HDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,661 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,600 | Target: Rs 1,770 | Return: 7 percentThe stock has completed a corrective pattern at Rs 1,560 and has reversed sharply on the back of broad based buying in the private sector bank stocks, which will help the stock to exhibit a trending move in the near term.However, we can be buyers only if it crosses Rs 1,670 or dips towards Rs 1,630. In either case, the stop-loss would be Rs 1,600. Above Rs 1,670 it will find resistance at Rs 1,720 and Rs 1,770.SRF: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,105 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,000 | Target: Rs 2,500 | Return: 19 percentThe stock is on the verge of completing a corrective pattern.

It will be an opportunity for traders and investors to invest in the stock from a medium term perspective. On the upside, on the reversal it would rally towards Rs 2,400 to Rs 2,500 levels. Keep a stop-loss at Rs 2,000 for holding positional long positions.Expert: Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand RathiMinda Corporation: Buy | LTP: Rs 228 | Stop-Loss: Rs 215 | Target: Rs 260 | Return: 14 percentThe weekly chart of Minda Corporation depicts a perfect symmetrical triangle breakout above Rs 230 mark.

It touched an intraday high of Rs 4,321.55 and an intraday low of Rs 4,120.

The operating profit margin fell to 15.95 percent in Q3FY23 from 19.88 percent in Q2FY23.In an interview to CNBC-TV18, CEO and managing director Debashis Chatterjee said that margin impact of 130 basis points (bps) was due to furloughs and lesser working days, while 100 bps margin impact was due to integration costs.""The company expects 200-250 bps improvement in margin in Q4 and expects operating margin to get back to pre-merger level. Momentum in pipeline and deals suggest growth in Q4 which will be better than Q3,"" Chatterjee said.He said that deferral in projects will not be client- and vertical-specific, adding that across portfolios, no deals were cancelled while some furloughs are likely to extend into Q4.""The purpose of the merger was to generate more synergies in the marketplace. We are very confident about the next 4-5 years for the company. We expect 200 bps of cost synergies over 4-5 years,"" the CEO added.Brokerages' view Jefferies has an ""underperform"" rating on the stock and has cut its target to Rs 3,710 per share, 14 percent below the current market price.

""Revenue miss was due to higher-than-expected furloughs and could correct in Q4. The sharp drop in the margin may take a few quarters to recover.

The research firm is of the view that Q3 print missed sharply across revenue, margin and EPS. Constant current (CC) growth displayed sharp deceleration while higher client cautiousness across sectors led to the deferral of projects.""EBIT margin fall was led by furloughs/seasonality and integration costs. It declined due to unexpected staff costs and fresh employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) grants.
