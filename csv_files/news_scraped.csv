Consolidation among larger and credible brands continues to be a key trend in the housing segment, primarily driven by rising confidence toward developers with strong execution legacy. In FY23, DLF’s pre-sales doubled YoY to INR155b, driven by a strong response to a new luxury project launched in Gurugram. Its identified launch pipeline will help the company sustain the momentum.  Expansion of new global captives, R&D and the technology sector will boost demand for office space. In Retail, there has been a significant rebound with improved footfalls. This resurgence is primarily supported by a recovery in the luxury segment. DLF maintains a positive outlook on the rental business and is consequently deploying capital to grow the office portfolio (developing 5.3msf across Gurugram and Chennai). Given a recovery in the retail segment and consumption trends in the country, DLF has also initiated the development of new sets of malls across geographies, with an aim of doubling its retail presence in the next 4-5 years. DLF continue to strengthen its sales, CRM and project execution teams, and its upgraded ERP system has significantly enhanced the company’s digital capabilities.OutlookThe current valuation indicates that the company’s 146msf land in DLF (DevCo.) and 24msf land in DCCDL (RentCo.) are valued at INR620b. This valuation incorporates a ~15 years of monetization timeline for the land bank, which we believe is fair.

Sequentially, however, profit is expected to show improvement despite a largely subdued revenue.Standalone net profit for the quarter ended June is seen rising 70 percent on-quarter to Rs 159.37 crore, but is may crash 80 percent on-year because of high base, as per the average estimate of three brokerage firm Moneycontrol covered. Revenue for the quarter under review is likely to decline by about 4 percent QoQ and 12 percent YoY to Rs 6,415.13 crore.Motilal Oswal Financial Services sees revenue for the Viscose Staple Fibre (VSF) and Chemical segments to decline 13 percent YoY and 21 percent YoY, respectively. VSF volumes are estimated to decline 5 percent YoY, while realisation is likely to drop 8 percent YoY, whereas the Chemical segment’s volumes are likely to rise 5 percent YoY, with a 25 percent YoY decline in realisation in Q1 of FY24, the brokerage firm added.Grasim Industries' overall sales witnessing a decline is largely because of muted volumes, and weaker realisations in VSF and chemical divisions, Sharekhan said.Meanwhile, Kotak Institutional Equities predicts a 3.1 percent YoY volume increase in VSF operations and 3.3 percent YoY volume increase in chemical operations. This is due to new capacity expansion, partly mitigated by near-term demand challenges, it said.Catch up on all LIVE stock market updates hereFurther, it anticipates an EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) of Rs 530 crore, comprising VSF EBITDA of Rs 300 crore (down 40 percent YoY, up 108 percent QoQ) and chemicals EBITDA of Rs 240 crore (down 70 percent YoY, down 36 percent QoQ). These figures, according to Kotak Institutional Equities, reflect reduced prices, moderated by decreased costs in both divisions compared to the previous year, but also include additional losses in the paints division.Operating margin is seen shrinking dramatically to 8.4 percent in the quarter ended June from 18.2 percent a year ago.

"  August 10, 2023 / 10:46 AM IST  ","Analyst Call Tracker | Banks dare margin pressure, dominate optimism list","Banking stocks featured prominently in analysts’ buy calls last month as robust credit demand, rising interest income, and stable asset quality boosted their investment profiles.Domestic banks have posted a strong set of numbers for Q1 FY24, with 30-100 percent growth in net profit, mostly in line with the estimates of brokerage firms.HDFC Bank, which completed the merger with HDFC last month, had 45 buy calls, one hold and zero sell calls, as per Moneycontrol’s Analyst Call Tracker for July.The country's largest private sector bank on July 17 reported a net profit of Rs 11,951 crore for the April-June quarter, a jump of 30 percent from Rs 9,196 crore last year.Net interest income (NII) - the difference between the interest earned on loans and paid to depositors - grew by 21.1 percent to Rs 23,599 crore from Rs 19,481 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2022. Total deposits stood at Rs 19.13 lakh crore, up 19.2 percent on a year-on-year basis.“Gross advances and deposits will continue to show robust growth in the foreseeable future, with a focus on higher retail participation. The merger unlocks significant synergies for the merged entity, including, but not limited to, lower cost of funds, access to HDFC’s sturdy housing loan portfolio and possibilities of cross-selling other financial products to its expanded customer base,” analysts at domestic brokerage firm Geojit said.More Analyst Trackers: LTIMindtree, newest entrant to Nifty 50 league, slips into bear zoneWinner Takes It AllThe country’s largest lender SBI has the maximum ‘buy’ calls on the list at 47, followed by Axis Bank, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank.SBI posted its highest-ever quarterly earnings at Rs 16,884 crore, soaring 178 percent on-year, though net interest income came in below estimates at Rs 38,905 crore.“Loan growth sustained across segments, led by continued traction in retail assets (especially Xpress Credit book) and the SME portfolio, which benefited from a gradual pick-up in the investment cycle,” HDFC Securities said in a note to clients.Axis Bank on July 26 reported a net profit of Rs 5,790 crore for the quarter ended April-June FY24, growing by 40 percent from Rs 4,125 crore last year.The lender's net interest income (NII) grew 27 percent on a year-on-year (YOY) basis to Rs 11,959 crore, while net interest margin (NIM) for the quarter stood at 4.10 percent, up 50 bps YOY.ICICI Bank reported a 39.7 percent on-year growth in standalone profit at Rs 9,648 crore for the quarter despite elevated provisions and contingencies.Net interest income increased by 38 percent on-year to Rs 18,227 crore with net interest margin expansion of 77 bps on-year at 4.78 percent, while loan growth was 18.1 percent and deposits grew by 17.9 percent YoY.Asset quality was stable with gross NPA falling 5 bps sequentially to 2.76 percent and net NPA flat at 0.48 percent for the quarter.“The bank has the highest earnings certainty over the next three years. Net interest margin (NIM) moderation has been in-line and deposit accretion has picked up pace. Core pre-provision operating profit (PPoP) was reported 37 percent higher YoY and the bank will invest in growth in FY24,” brokerage firm CLSA said.Margin PressuresWhile banks had a standout quarter overall, when looked at sequentially, the numbers reveal some stress on the margins front.For example, the net interest income for SBI declined 4 percent QoQ, led by a sharp 27 bps QoQ decline in net interest margin to 3.33 percent. Axis Bank’s NIMs moderated 12 bps sequentially.Analysts say catch-up in funding costs following accelerated funds mobilisation is expected to squeeze margins and weigh on banks’ balance sheets in the near-term.Banks will have to hike interest rates further to chase depositors, and on the other hand, the loan book has been largely repriced as more than half of it is linked to external benchmark lending rate (EBLR).On the advances side, while banks are chasing retail borrowers, corporate loan offtake is still subdued.“Banks saw strong margin delivery in FY23, benefiting from lead/lag of asset-liability re-pricing, consumption of internal liquidity and lower NPA formation. However, we believe that the on-balance-sheet liquidity has been largely consumed, while higher deposit growth coupled with the lagging repricing should catch up, leading to margin softness in FY24 for most banks,” analysts at Emkay Global said.It believes the rate hike cycle is largely behind, thus, managing the liability cost becomes vital for protecting margins. “That said, a few banks with lower loan-to-deposit ratio (such as SBI) or higher share of MCLR (Indian Bank) to be repriced should be able to protect their margins or witness relatively lesser correction.

The company's revenue increased 4.5 percent to Rs 8,767.27 crore in Q1FY24 as against Rs 8,392.54 crore in the year-ago period.Lower commodity costs, price hikes, positive operating leverage and a richer product mix also helped the company boost its bottom line.Niranjan Gupta, Chief Executive Officer, Hero MotoCorp, said, “Our underlying margins in ICE business have returned to pre‐Covid levels, providing us the necessary fuel for growth as we move forward. The singular focus as we move ahead will be growth and market share.”The performanceThe country’s largest two-wheeler maker posted robust financials despite a dip in volumes. The company’s total sales, including exports, declined by 3 percent to 13.53 lakh units during the April to June period vis-à-vis 13.90 lakh units in the same period last year. Domestic sales were marginally down by 0.8 percent on a YoY basis while exports slumped by 43 percent.“We have begun strengthening our presence in the premium segment and pre‐booking numbers for Harley Davidson X440 is a good start. We will see more launches of new models in this segment over the next few quarters, as we intend to win big in the premium segment. Our EV presence is getting scaled up and we are on track to cover 100 cities by December this year,"" added Gupta.The company’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) for Q1FY24 stood at Rs 1,206 crore, up 28 percent.Driven by softening of commodity costs, accelerated savings programs, and judicious price increases, the EBITDA margin for the quarter stood at 13.8 percent, reflecting an improvement of 250 basis points (bps). The underlying EBITDA margin for the ICE business stands at 14.5 percent, excluding the impact of the EV business.EBITDA margin is a measure of a company's operating profit as a percentage of its revenue. Profit Before Tax and exceptional items for the quarter was at Rs 1,255 crore, a growth of 52 percent over Rs 824 crore reported in the previous quarter. Consolidated revenue from operations stood at Rs 8,851 crore, a growth of 5 percent over the previous year, and PAT at Rs 701 crore, a growth of 20 percent over the previous year.Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities attributed the drop in sales volumes to continued weakness in the entry-level motorcycle segment demand.Meets St expectationsThe results were in line with analysts’ expectations. According to a poll of five brokerages, Hero MotoCorp’s net profit during the first quarter of this fiscal was expected to rise 26 percent YoY to Rs 786 crore. The company’s revenue from operations was projected to increase 4.5 percent to Rs 8,754 crore, as per the estimates.The analysts had claimed that while total vehicle sales are likely to fall by 3 percent on a YoY basis there will be a 7 percent increase in sales over the last quarter. On the other hand, exports are poised to fall 43 percent from the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal.Recently, Nirmal Bang, in its earnings estimates, expected Hero MotoCorp to report a net profit of Rs 775 crore up 23.6 percent YoY (up 9 percent quarter on quarter). Furthermore, net sales were expected to increase 9.8 percent YoY (up 1.5 percent QoQ) to Rs 8,150.7 crore, according to the brokerage.Nirmal Bang had also predicted that EBITDA was likely to rise by 18.8 percent YoY (up 6.4 percent QoQ) to Rs 983.3 crore.On August 10, Hero MotoCorp’s share price dropped 0.91 percent to Rs 3,029.35 on the BSE.The outlookMeanwhile, Hero MotoCorp expects the momentum to build up in the coming quarters on account of “favourable economic indicators” and “positive consumer sentiments”. With a slew of new launches lined up this year, the company is also accelerating its presence in the premium space.“The key economic indicators are trending in a positive direction and a normal monsoon augurs well for demand as we will soon enter the festive season.

"  August 10, 2023 / 01:45 PM IST  ",Market corrects post RBI MPC outcome| Bet on these top 10 rate-sensitive stocks,"The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) unanimously decided to hold the repo rate at 6.5 percent, but raised the full-year inflation forecast to 5.4 percent from 5.1 percent earlier given the supply disruptions due to adverse weather conditions and assuming a normal monsoon, which was largely on expected lines.""The MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target, while supporting growth,"" the Reserve Bank of India said in its release.The MPC has also maintained its real GDP growth forecast for current financial year 2023-24 at 6.5 percent considering the hope for better household consumption, and renewal of the capex cycle going ahead, amid global headwinds.""There were no surprises in the policy and unlike market expectations, there was no hawkish bend to the commentary,"" Indranil Pan, Chief Economist at YES Bank said.However, he further said as any good central bank would do, the RBI signals that it would continue to look ahead and factor in its anticipated inflation trajectory into future monetary policy decisions, and opined that excessive liquidity can pose risks to price stability.Meanwhile, the RBI has attempted to neutralize the liquidity impact of the Rs 2000/- notes into the banking system, and has hiked incremental CRR (cash reserve ratio) to 10 percent till September 2023 to address surplus liquidity generated by various factors.The market has reacted negatively to the rising inflation forecast and incremental CRR for banks announced by the RBI. Hence the Bank Nifty fell 240 points to 44,640, while the BSE Sensex fell 246 points to 65,750, and the Nifty50 dropped 69 points to 19,564, at 12:49 hours IST.But experts are not worried due to this fall, in fact, it gives an opportunity to pick quality stocks including rate sensitive stocks on dips. They still feel the market is in a consolidation phase and can give decisive breakout over crucial 19,650-19,700 levels soon, as long as it holds the 19,500-19,300 support. Overall it traded within the previous day's range.""We believe that a dip in the market is a much needed. The RBI move may pave the way for healthy correction. If Bank Nifty fails to hold above the 44,500 mark then there is a chance of a fall till 43,500. This is a major support level for Bank Nifty where investors can get it to good quality banking stocks,"" Apurva Sheth, head of market perspectives & research at SAMCO Securities said.On the Nifty50, Osho Krishan, senior. analyst, technical & derivative research at Angel One feels the bearish gap of 19,678-19,705 withholds the immediate hurdle and a decisive breach would attract new longs in the index for the next potential resistance around 19,800-19,850 in the comparable period. While on the downside, the pivotal support of 19,500 proved its mettle and is expected to cushion any blip in the shortcoming, he said.Follow LIVE Updates of the RBI Monetary Policy decision hereWe have collated a list of rate-sensitive stocks that may be a good buy at current levels or on dips from a two to three weeks’ perspective. Returns are calculated based on August 9 closing price:Expert: Foram Chheda, CMT, technical research analyst and founder of ChartAnalytics.co.inHDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,647 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,612 | Target: Rs 1,720 | Return: 4.4 percentAfter marking a high on a closing basis in July this year, HDFC Bank's stock price saw a corrective decline and halted at Rs 1,579-1,580 levels which was in close proximity to the 200-day MA (moving average) marking it as a strong support level.The price movement after that led to the development of the symmetrical triangle. Currently, the stock is very close to multiple moving average support level at 50-day, 100-day and 200-day MA which is expected to act as a strong support level and the price is likely to move towards the previous highs of Rs 1,720 levels.Thus, one should continue to hold the stock with stop-loss of Rs 1,612 and can expect a potential up move towards Rs 1,720 levels.Manappuram Finance: Buy | LTP: Rs 142.40 | Stop-Loss: Rs 131 | Target: Rs 155 | Return: 9 percentSince February 2022, Manappuram Finance has been in a consolidation phase. After reaching a low point at Rs 81 levels in June 2022, the stock gradually climbed. During its ascent, it surpassed the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day moving averages. However, its upward momentum slowed around Rs 133-134 levels, acting as a resistance, and a corrective decline followed. This decline found support near the 200-day moving average. A rebound in the price followed this price action.In the past month, the price tested the resistance at Rs 131-133 levels multiple times. Finally, a breakout occurred which took the price above the horizontal trendline resistance of Rs 133, creating fresh buying opportunities.Presently, one can hold the stock, maintain a stop-loss near Rs 131, while expecting an upward move towards Rs 155.L&T Finance Holdings: Buy | LTP: Rs 126.2 | Stop-Loss: Rs 119 | Target: Rs 138-140 | Return: 11 percentAfter forming a bottom at Rs 78 levels in March this year, the stock price has witnessed a rebound. Despite a temporary violation, the price defended the 200-day MA as its support by staging a rebound and crossing above it. This reinforced the levels of 200-DMA as a major support for the stock.The price gradually crossed above multiple moving averages of 50-day MA as well as 100-day MA which concluded the trend of the stock to be bullish. This up move in price halted near Rs 140 levels last month and retraced nearly 23.6 percent as per the Fibonacci retracement levels getting very close to the 50-day MA in the process.Thus, the formation of higher tops and higher bottoms, Fibonacci retracement of 23.6 percent, and 50-day MA support level can trigger a rebound in price which could result in a potential continuation of the uptrend. One can continue holding the stock with a stop-loss of Rs 119 and look for a potential up move close to Rs 138-140 levels.Expert: Vidnyan Sawant, AVP - technical research at GEPL CapitalICICI Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 972.7 | Stop-Loss: Rs 940 | Target: Rs 1,040 | Return: 7 percentICICI Bank's stock is currently trading around its all-time high levels and has shown a pattern of forming higher tops and higher bottoms on the monthly charts. This pattern suggests a strong positive sentiment for the stock over the long term. Recently, the stock has found support around the previous swing high, which has now become a new support level due to the concept of change in polarity (CIP). This indicates a bullish signal for the stock, with this support level forming around Rs 960.Furthermore, the stock has been consistently trading above its important moving averages, including the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day moving averages. This alignment of moving averages in a positive direction indicates the bullish strength of the stock's trend.The relative strength index (RSI), a momentum indicator, has been indicating positive momentum on various time frames such as daily, weekly, and monthly. It has consistently remained above the 50 mark, reinforcing the presence of a favorable upward momentum in the stock's price.Looking ahead, there is potential for the upward movement of the stock to continue, possibly targeting Rs 1,040 levels. It's recommended to set a stop-loss at Rs 940, which should be triggered on a closing basis.Canara Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 336.10 | Stop-Loss: Rs 320 | Target: Rs 360 | Return: 7 percentCanara Bank stock has rebounded positively from the critical support level of Rs 325, which shows a change in polarity at the same level. A notable Cup & Handle pattern breakout in early July 2023 suggested the onset of a bullish trend.This upward trend is further reinforced as the stock prices consistently take support from the 12 & 26-day exponential moving averages (EMA). Additionally, the RSI displays a positive hidden divergence, indicating strong positive momentum in the stock.Going ahead, we can expect the up move to continue till Rs 360 levels, where the stop-loss must be Rs 320 on closing basis.PNB Housing Finance: Buy | LTP: Rs 634.55 | Stop-Loss: Rs 600 | Target: Rs 700 | Return: 10 percentPNB Housing stock has made an impressive rise from its lower levels around Rs 380, evident from the rising steepness of the trend lines. The stock consistently forms higher highs and higher lows, indicating a sustained upward momentum.This bullish sentiment is further validated as, during every decline, the stock rebounds from its variable support levels defined by the 12-day and 26-day EMAs.Moreover, the RSI exhibits a Positive Hidden Divergence, underscoring the prevailing positive momentum. Going ahead we can expect the up move to continue till Rs 700 level where the stop-loss must be Rs 600 on closing basis.RBL Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 220.95 | Stop-Loss: Rs 205 | Target: Rs 270 | Return: 22 percentRBL Bank is currently trading close to its 52-week high, maintaining a higher top higher bottom pattern on the monthly charts, suggesting a positive long-term trend. Additionally, on the weekly chart, the stock has broken out of an Inverted Head & Shoulder pattern and is sustaining above that level, confirming a robust positive sentiment in the medium term. In the short term, the stock seems to be finding support around Rs 205 – 200 levels.Moreover, the stock has consistently traded above key moving averages, including the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day moving averages. This alignment of moving averages in a positive direction further underscores the bullish trajectory of the stock.The RSI, a momentum indicator, has consistently indicated positive momentum across various time frames such as daily, weekly, and monthly. The RSI has consistently maintained levels above 55, highlighting the presence of strong upward momentum in the stock's price.Looking forward, there is potential for the stock's upward movement to persist, with a potential target around Rs 270 levels. To manage risk, it is advisable to implement a stop-loss strategy at Rs 205, which should be activated based on closing prices.Expert: Mitesh Karwa, research analyst at Bonanza PortfolioAshok Leyland: Buy | LTP: Rs 187.55 | Stop-Loss: Rs 178 | Target: Rs 207 | Return: 10 percentA significant breakout of a Cup and Handle pattern in Ashok Leyland has been observed. This pattern often indicates a potential bullish continuation of the existing trend. The good volume during the breakout suggests increased buying interest at the current price levels, which further reinforces the positive outlook.Moreover, the price is trading above the major EMA, indicating a sustained uptrend. This alignment with the EMAs adds more confidence to the bullish scenario. Simultaneously, the technical indicator Ichimoku Cloud suggests that the price is trading above the conversion and base line which shows a Positive trend in the counter.Hence, based on the above technical structure one can initiate a long position in Ashok Leyland at Rs 187.55 or buy on a dip till Rs 187 levels can be used as buying opportunity for the upside target of Rs 207. However, the bullish view will be negated if Ashok Leyland closes below the support level of Rs 178.Hero MotoCorp: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,059.7 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,850 | Target: Rs 3,500 | Return: 14 percentIn the weekly timeframe, Hero price retraced 0.618 percent from its high after an upward move. The stock found support at the EMA and rebounded, approaching the previous high. This is accompanied by a pattern of higher highs and higher lows, indicating a bullish trend.Additionally, the price remains above the 100-period EMA and the Ichimoku Indicator, supporting the uptrend. The RSI momentum indicator is also trending, with new highs, confirming the trend.In light of these technical factors, a long position could be considered at Rs 3,059 or a potential decline to Rs 3,050, with a target price of Rs 3,500. However, this bullish view would be invalidated if the stock closes below the support level of Rs 2,850.Bank of Maharashtra: Buy | LTP: Rs 37.3 | Stop-Loss: Rs 30 | Target: Rs 50 | Return: 34 percentBank of Maharashtra has seen breaking out of an Inverse Head and Shoulder pattern on the weekly timeframe with a bullish candlestick pattern and closing above the highs of last six years which indicates strength. The stock is also trading above all its important EMAs on the daily timeframe which acts as a confluence.The supertrend indicator is also indicating a bullish continuation which supports the bullish view. Momentum oscillator RSI (14) is at around 75 on the daily time frame indicating strength by sustaining above 50 and the ichimoku cloud is also suggesting a bullish move as the price is trading above the conversion line, base line and cloud.Observation of the above factors indicates that a bullish move in Bank of Maharashtra is possible for target upto Rs 50. One can initiate a buy trade in between the range of Rs 37-37.3, with stop-loss of Rs 30 on daily closing basis.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

"  August 10, 2023 / 08:17 PM IST  ","HUL, Titan, Asian Paints downgraded by brokerages, rating changed to 'hold' from 'buy'","Hindustan Unilever, Titan, and Asian Paints have fewer buy calls on their stock in August as compared to last month.Hindustan Unilever had 36 buy calls in July, but this number has reduced to 26 buy calls in August. Brokerages have downgraded Hindustan Unilever stock from a ‘buy’ rating to a ‘hold’ or ‘neutral’ rating.Prabhudas Lilladher downgraded its rating on Hindustan Unilever to ‘hold’ from ‘accumulate’ before. The downgrade was done factoring in tepid volume growth in the food and refreshment and personal wash segments in the April-to-June quarter.Also Read: HUL Q1 disappoints on weak demand, volume growth at 3%The domestic brokerage firm said that HUL’s price cut strategy to compete with local players will diminish in the longer run. This means that the excitement around lower prices will fade away gradually as people get used to the new prices, making it less effective in the long run. Rural markets have, however, started to improve. Prabhudas Lilladher expects erratic weather conditions to increase inflation in daily use items and disrupt Hindustan Unilever’s volume recovery path.Yes Securities has cut its rating on Hindustan Unilever to ‘neutral’ from ‘add’ earlier and revised the target price to Rs 2,890. The brokerage firm sees limited upside on the stock in anticipation of a slower volume growth in coming quarters.Yes Securities said that even tough rural markets are showing improvement and that demand in rural areas will come back slowly as people are still using the high priced inventory in the market. Resurgence of small players and reducing stock levels in anticipation of further input price cuts will also lead to slower volume growth for Hindustan Unilever.TitanTitan had 27 buy calls in July, and now has 23. Phillip Capital has downgraded the stock to ‘neutral’ from ‘buy’ earlier and revised the target price to Rs 3,100. Phillip Capital expects increased advertising spends to lower margins further as Titan is investing on above-the-line and below-the-line activities to increase its market share. Above-the-line usually refers to costs above the gross profit, which includes cost of goods sold -- cost of raw materials, wages, other facilities costs which go into producing the goods. Below-the-line expenses include operating expenses, interest and taxes.Also Read: Titan Q1 results: Net profit falls 4.3% to Rs 756 crore; revenue up 26%, misses estimatesThe brokerage firm expects consumer demand to moderate on account of higher gold prices and pent-up demand. The brokerage firm believes that Titan has rich valuations and the stock does not see any meaningful appreciation.Another brokerage DART has cut its rating for Titan to ‘sell’ with a target price of Rs 2,980 as it believes the stock has become expensive. The brokerage firm said, “Although Titan’s Q1 profitability was lower than estimates, we maintain our FY24-25 Earnings Per Share estimates at Rs 42.5 in FY24 and 48.5 in FY25 as we believe that the profitability going ahead would improve significantly.”Asian PaintsAsian Paints now have 12 buy calls, down from 15 in July. Axis Securities has cut the rating to ‘hold’ from ‘buy’ earlier and revised the target price to Rs 3,500. The brokerage firm believes the stock has limited upside potential in the near-term as competition from the new entrants is likely to intensify. And this will keep the profitability under check. However, Axis Securities is positive on the long-term prospects of the company.Also Read: Asian Paints net profit jumps 52% on double‐digit volume growth in Indian decorative businessPrabhudas Lilladher has cut the rating from ‘accumulate’ to ‘hold’ earlier, given the EPS valuations of 53.5x in FY25 and increased competition from Grasim and JSW in coming years. However, the brokerage firm is positive on long-term growth levers for Asian Paints on the back of the company’s increasing market share in decorative paints and high growth in waterproofing and the wood finishes business.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

"  August 10, 2023 / 10:46 AM IST  ","Analyst Call Tracker | Banks dare margin pressure, dominate optimism list","Banking stocks featured prominently in analysts’ buy calls last month as robust credit demand, rising interest income, and stable asset quality boosted their investment profiles.Domestic banks have posted a strong set of numbers for Q1 FY24, with 30-100 percent growth in net profit, mostly in line with the estimates of brokerage firms.HDFC Bank, which completed the merger with HDFC last month, had 45 buy calls, one hold and zero sell calls, as per Moneycontrol’s Analyst Call Tracker for July.The country's largest private sector bank on July 17 reported a net profit of Rs 11,951 crore for the April-June quarter, a jump of 30 percent from Rs 9,196 crore last year.Net interest income (NII) - the difference between the interest earned on loans and paid to depositors - grew by 21.1 percent to Rs 23,599 crore from Rs 19,481 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2022. Total deposits stood at Rs 19.13 lakh crore, up 19.2 percent on a year-on-year basis.“Gross advances and deposits will continue to show robust growth in the foreseeable future, with a focus on higher retail participation. The merger unlocks significant synergies for the merged entity, including, but not limited to, lower cost of funds, access to HDFC’s sturdy housing loan portfolio and possibilities of cross-selling other financial products to its expanded customer base,” analysts at domestic brokerage firm Geojit said.More Analyst Trackers: LTIMindtree, newest entrant to Nifty 50 league, slips into bear zoneWinner Takes It AllThe country’s largest lender SBI has the maximum ‘buy’ calls on the list at 47, followed by Axis Bank, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank.SBI posted its highest-ever quarterly earnings at Rs 16,884 crore, soaring 178 percent on-year, though net interest income came in below estimates at Rs 38,905 crore.“Loan growth sustained across segments, led by continued traction in retail assets (especially Xpress Credit book) and the SME portfolio, which benefited from a gradual pick-up in the investment cycle,” HDFC Securities said in a note to clients.Axis Bank on July 26 reported a net profit of Rs 5,790 crore for the quarter ended April-June FY24, growing by 40 percent from Rs 4,125 crore last year.The lender's net interest income (NII) grew 27 percent on a year-on-year (YOY) basis to Rs 11,959 crore, while net interest margin (NIM) for the quarter stood at 4.10 percent, up 50 bps YOY.ICICI Bank reported a 39.7 percent on-year growth in standalone profit at Rs 9,648 crore for the quarter despite elevated provisions and contingencies.Net interest income increased by 38 percent on-year to Rs 18,227 crore with net interest margin expansion of 77 bps on-year at 4.78 percent, while loan growth was 18.1 percent and deposits grew by 17.9 percent YoY.Asset quality was stable with gross NPA falling 5 bps sequentially to 2.76 percent and net NPA flat at 0.48 percent for the quarter.“The bank has the highest earnings certainty over the next three years. Net interest margin (NIM) moderation has been in-line and deposit accretion has picked up pace. Core pre-provision operating profit (PPoP) was reported 37 percent higher YoY and the bank will invest in growth in FY24,” brokerage firm CLSA said.Margin PressuresWhile banks had a standout quarter overall, when looked at sequentially, the numbers reveal some stress on the margins front.For example, the net interest income for SBI declined 4 percent QoQ, led by a sharp 27 bps QoQ decline in net interest margin to 3.33 percent. Axis Bank’s NIMs moderated 12 bps sequentially.Analysts say catch-up in funding costs following accelerated funds mobilisation is expected to squeeze margins and weigh on banks’ balance sheets in the near-term.Banks will have to hike interest rates further to chase depositors, and on the other hand, the loan book has been largely repriced as more than half of it is linked to external benchmark lending rate (EBLR).On the advances side, while banks are chasing retail borrowers, corporate loan offtake is still subdued.“Banks saw strong margin delivery in FY23, benefiting from lead/lag of asset-liability re-pricing, consumption of internal liquidity and lower NPA formation. However, we believe that the on-balance-sheet liquidity has been largely consumed, while higher deposit growth coupled with the lagging repricing should catch up, leading to margin softness in FY24 for most banks,” analysts at Emkay Global said.It believes the rate hike cycle is largely behind, thus, managing the liability cost becomes vital for protecting margins. “That said, a few banks with lower loan-to-deposit ratio (such as SBI) or higher share of MCLR (Indian Bank) to be repriced should be able to protect their margins or witness relatively lesser correction. Also, banks with a higher fixed-rate asset book, coupled with a reasonable CASA base, should see margin expansion, once the rate cycle reverses,” it said.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.
