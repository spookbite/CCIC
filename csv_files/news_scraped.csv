Going forward, we believe export volumes have bottomed out as demand is improving now month on month (however availability of USD remains an uncertain area), while domestic 2W volumes should continue their strong run. We also expect a strong traction coming from new launches which would drive overall demand. >125cc segment has provided new identity to BAL. Solid performance of premium Pulsar models, KTM bikes and expected launch of Triumph this year should all provide the required fillip to both volumes and margins. On the exports front, markets like ASEAN and Latam markets should be able to somewhat offset weaknesss in Africa. With 2W Chetak expanding its coverage and fetching good response, we believe Chetak to add to the numbers substantially in H2 of FY24. The withdrawal of FAME subsidy remains a concern for the EV 2Ws, but we believe it to impact BAL little. 3W performance was robust in Q4, touching new highs, on CNG success. EV 3W launch should further aid the business. Favorable product mix and currency movement, neutral RM prices, price hikes planned and prudent cost management should assist margins in the ensuing quarters. With strong balance sheet, robust return ratios, hefty dividend yield of 3.3% in FY23 and zero financial leverage, we believe the stock looks attractive at 15.1x FY 25E earnings.OutlookWe therefore maintain our BUY rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 4,696 (at 16.5x FY 25E earnings).For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Margin beat was largely driven by higher spares and a better-than-expected export mix (sharp decline in African exports). Management indicated that although retail demand in key export markets is likely to have bottomed out, the lack of availability of USD for trade remains the major factor hampering export visibility. The domestic motorcycle industry continues to see demand weakness and management is now guiding for 6-8% volume growth over next few quarters for the industry. Also, we believe that once volumes revive, even the current favorable mix will normalize. This coupled with the slight under-recovery of the recent cost inflation is likely to keep margins under pressure from here on.OutlookAt 17.6x FY25E, the stock appears expensive.

BJAUT reported better than expected 4Q revenue, while EBITDA margin was largely in line with our above street estimates. Margins expanded helped by significant inventorisation benefit, higher spare mix and better vehicle mix, offset by lower operating leverage. Concerns on the export volumes continue (~50% of sales) with BJAUT delaying the recovery timelines led by uncertainty on unavailability of USD and lower affordability. Also, lack of market share gains in the domestic motorcycles market over the last few years, and increase in competition could lead to further pricing actions.OutlookHowever, we expect BJAUT’s domestic premium segment volumes to grow (similar to the industry) helped by premiumisation trends and fast ramp-up of EVs could make us turn constructive on the stock.
