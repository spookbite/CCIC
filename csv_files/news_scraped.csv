To pay off the amount, it can divest all its assets but the renewable energy firm will still be on a growth path, research firm Bernstein has said in its latest report.Adani Green is one of the worst-hit stocks among the Adani group companies after American short-seller Hinderburg  Research in a report in late January accused the conglomerate of stock manipulation, other wrong-doings and flagged debt concerns. The group has denied the charges.Adani Green has operating assets of 7.3 giga watts (GW). “Renewable assets can fetch 8-10x EV/EBITDA multiple. Applying the same for Adani Green, we see an EV of Rs 45,100 crore – Rs 56,400 crore. This is enough to clear the entire debt taken by Adani Green,” the foreign research firm said.Vector Green’s acquisition by Sembcorp fetched an EV/EBITDA multiple of 8.5x and Sprng’s acquisition by Shell was about 8-9x EV/EBITDA, it said, driving home the point.Also Read: Adani Green Energy net profit surges 110%, revenue 41% in Q3“Flipping renewable assets is a common practice and there is a ready market, given 25 year cash-flow visibility and each asset in an SPV or special purpose vehicle. Potential buyers for these assets could include JSW, Brookfield, Sembcorp, Torrent, Macquarie, Blackrock, CPPIB, InvITs like Indigrid etc,” Bernstein said.But, if the company sells all its assets, what will it be left with? Enough, to continue its growth journey, as per the firm.Adani Green Energy in its Q3 earnings presentation informed that 13.1 GW of the renewable portfolio is locked-in, either under construction or near construction. So even after divesting all its current operating assets, it will have 13.1 GW of resources.Also Read: Adani crisis: S&P says Indian banks may charge higher risk premia“A large part of this pipeline is formed by solar+manufacturing linked PPA (power purchase agreement) of 5.9 GW which is at a good tariff of Rs 2.45/ kwh. They also have 1.3 GW of hybrid contracts of which one is at an attractive tariff of Rs 3.24/kwh,” Bernstein said.If the company is not keen on ""extreme divestment"", it could seek fresh investments from existing investors with ""skin in the game"" like TotalEnergies and IHC. The research firm also said Adani Green Energy should avoid bidding in new opportunities till leverage comes down.Bernstein has an “underperform” rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 628. “But, we believe they have quality assets, strong contracts and can manage the debt repayment due in FY25,” it said.Since the publication of the Hindenburg report on January 24, Adani Green Energy has declined almost 66 percent.

"  February 15, 2023 / 06:39 AM IST  ","Hot Stocks | Bet on Finolex Cables, Poonawalla Fincorp, Cigniti Tech for double-digit returns","The Nifty is trading at a crucial juncture of 17,950, which is a cluster of the 100-DMA (daily moving average), the Budget day's high, and a down-sloping trendline. If the benchmark index manages to cross this level, then we can expect a short-covering rally in the market, where 18,080-18,200 will be the first resistance zone and 18,440 will be the next target level.However, if the Nifty sees selling pressure from here, then there will be a risk of a move towards the 200-DMA, which is currently placed at 17,320, where 17,650 is an intermediate support level.Bank Nifty is also in the critical resistance zone of 41,500–41,725; above this, we can expect a short-covering move towards 42,300 and 42,700 levels. However, if it encounters selling pressure from here, it may revisit 40,000 level.The US inflation number is a critical factor, while institutional flows will be another important trigger for the direction of the market.Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks:Poonawalla Fincorp: Buy | LTP: Rs 312.7 | Stop-Loss: Rs 290 | Target: Rs 354 | Return: 13 percentThe counter is witnessing a breakout of an Inverse Head & Shoulder pattern formation in the long-term timeframe. It is coming out of long-term consolidation on the daily chart. The breakout is led by heavy volume and has closed above the breakout level after 2 months.On the upside, Rs 320 is an immediate hurdle. Above this, we can expect a move towards Rs 350+. On the downside, Rs 290 is a strong demand zone at any pullback.While the moving average convergence and divergence (MACD) indicator is experiencing an upward centerline crossover, the relative strength index (RSI), a momentum indicator, is positively poised.Finolex Cables: Buy | LTP: Rs 598 | Stop-Loss: Rs 550 | Target: Rs 694 | Return: 16 percentThe counter is in a classical bullish momentum and forming higher highs & higher lows formation on the longer timeframe. It has also witnessed a breakout of ascending triangle formation on the daily chart. The overall structure of the counter is very lucrative as it is trading above all important moving averages.On the upside, the levels of Rs 640 operate as vulnerable levels; above these, we can anticipate a protracted move towards Rs 690+ in the shorter to longer term. On the downside, Rs 550 acts as crucial support during any pullback.The momentum indicator MACD (moving average convergence divergence) is sustaining the current strength, and the RSI (relative strength index) is also poised favourably.Cigniti Technologies: Buy | LTP: Rs 709 | Stop-Loss: Rs 650 | Target: Rs 824 | Return: 16 percentMultiple bullish setups have occurred on the counter, including a breakout of an ascending triangle formation and a breakout of an Inverse Head and Shoulders formation. There is also a breakout of a bullish flag formation with strong volume.Most of the momentum indicators are positively poised and support the breakout move at this counter. On the upside, if Rs 750, an immediate hurdle, gets surpassed, we can expect a move toward the Rs 810–820 zone. On the downside, Rs 650 will act as a strong demand zone.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.
