On the higher end, 18,400-18,450 is likely to act as the sturdy wall and a decisive breach would only trigger fresh longs in the system in future.Mitesh Karwa, Research Analyst at Bonanza Portfolio, feels the coming week is of extreme importance for the market as it will decide the trend for the next leg. ""The 18,200 levels are expected to act as a strong support zone and if held in the current week, the Nifty will start moving towards 18,500-18,600 levels,"" he said, adding that the Nifty is trading above its 200 EMA at 17,636 indicates strength.Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks.

After hitting Rs 2,509 level, it moved back towards Rs 2,419 level which is a support level as a Supertrend study.After hitting the support zone, it has formed a bullish reversal formation, which can help the stock move higher towards Rs 2,550. However, till the stock does not cross the recent high of Rs 2,509 then buying should be done with a target of Rs 2,500. The stop-loss is at Rs 2,415.Ajanta Pharma: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,301.35 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,200 | Target: Rs 1,550 | Return: 19 percentSince February 2022, the stock has been consolidating between the trading range of Rs 1,130 and Rs 1,430, however, it was missing the higher bottom formation, which it has established in the last week.Now till at least Rs 1,400, the journey to the upside would be smooth and above Rs 1,430 it will validate the formation of a double bottom.On a weekly basis, the stock closed above the previous week's high, making it a buy candidate. Buy at Rs 1,300 and Buy at Rs 1,250, with a stop-loss at Rs 1,200.

In the last week, the stock closed above the highest level of the last 5 weeks.Based on the above formation, it could move towards Rs 85 with a major hurdle at Rs 80.

If a breakout above this level occurs, it could trigger a significant short-covering rally towards 47,000+ level in the near term, he feels.Q: Are the charts telling you that the Nifty can hit its record high in June?The market is experiencing a strong upward trend due to recent buying activity from foreign institutional investors (FIIs). However, the mixed quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) numbers are introducing volatility in various stocks and sectors.Based on the technical chart analysis, there is a greater likelihood that the Nifty index will reach a five-week high, specifically the 18,887.60 mark. Moreover, there is a possibility of surpassing the previous high and achieving a new record high, with the index potentially reaching the 19,000+ level in June 2023.Q: If you feel the rally is likely in coming weeks, then which are the sectors that can contribute the most?Considering the prevailing market momentum and the movement of different sectors, there is a greater likelihood of sectors such as banking, financial services, automobile, fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), and capital goods performing well in the near future.Also Read: This fund manager is bullish on financials, capital goods, export manufacturersSectors like pharmaceuticals are expected to continue drawing selective buying interest. Additionally, the technology sector may witness unexpected buying activity or short-covering during the June series expiry.Q: What is your take on the Bank Nifty?There is a possibility of renewed buying in Bank Nifty, although a temporary dip towards 42,000 level may occur in the near future. This dip could present a favourable buying opportunity for long-term investors.However, it's important to note that the current market momentum may encounter strong resistance near the 52-week high of 44,151.80. If a breakout above this level occurs, it could trigger a significant short-covering rally towards the 47,000+ level in the near term.Q: Which stocks are on your radar for next week?Based on the current momentum, we anticipate increased buying activity in Larsen & Toubro, Persistent Systems, Reliance Industries, and Axis Bank in the upcoming days.Also Read: RBI unlikely to change policy stance in the next few meetings, says Weekend Investing founderQ: Do you see further rally in Cholamandalam Financial Holdings after a 36-percent run in current month so far?Cholamandalam Financial Holdings experienced significant buying activity after a breakout. In recent days, it surged from Rs 800 to Rs 1,043, driven by buying and subsequent short-covering.Based on the technical analysis, we anticipate the counter to consolidate in the near term, potentially reaching around Rs 900 level. Therefore, we recommend short-term investors to book partial profits at this point.Q: Do you think the Nifty Auto is marching towards 15,000 mark and will that be possible in June?The auto sector has performed admirably recently, demonstrating a consistent upward movement from 12,500 to 14,000 levels. However, it is worth noting that 14,000 is a significant resistance level from a technical standpoint.To continue its upward trajectory towards 15,500 level, a breakout above 14,000 is required.

We believe that the sale is in-line with SIEMS long term strategy 1) to be a leading tech-oriented company, 2) consolidate its business in high-growth areas to achieve synergies and 3) move up in value chain by providing solutions for electrification, digitalization and automation.
