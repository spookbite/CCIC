For EIM, structural domestic franchise revival (with the response to Hunter distinguishing EIM as a serial winner and given the slew of other planned launches) and ramp-up in exports (post many years of seeding), along with better mix and softer commodity prices would drive ~25% FY23-25E EPS CAGR (refer our recent 2W note).OutlookWe upgrade FY24E EPS by ~11% and retain BUY, with ~18% upside; our SOTP-based TP at Rs4,000/sh (Rs3,590 earlier) is based on 25x PER/20x PER for the motorcycle/CV business, on FY25 estimates.For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Eicher Motors’ (EIM) 4QFY23 consolidated EBITDA margin at 24.5% came above BBG consensus (24%) but missed PLe (25.1%); margins expaned 150bps QoQ given (1) higher-than-expected ASPs on better mix, (2) lower commodity prices and (3) price hikes; despite de-inventorisation impact. Royal Enfield (RE) was an exception in auto space and didn’t see weakness on rural side. RE has planned multiple product launches over next 2 years, which should aid volume growth. On the CV side, VECV should benefit from continued growth in the CV industry. EIM remains our preferred pick in the 2W space as we anticipate (1) volume growth from new product launches, (2) higher export revenue mix, (3) increase in mix of spares and merchandise revenue to aid both revenue growth and margin expansion.OutlookMaintain ‘BUY’ with a revised SoTP based TP of Rs 4,030 (at 26x Mar-25E standalone EPS and 12x EV/EBITDA for VECV).For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

PAT of Rs. 224 crore was up 31% q-o-q, beating our estimate by 14% led by significantly higher other income and lower tax rate. Gas transmission volumes recovered by 12% q-o-q to 25 mmscmd (below our estimate of 26 mmscmd) and EBITDA margin also declined by 2.7% q-o-q to Rs. 1.3/scm (2% below estimate). Decline of 9% q-o-q in Net transmission tariff to Rs. 1.5/scm could be attributed to lower ship-or-pay charges. Volume from CGD/refinery & petchem/power grew by 18%/12%/62% q-o-q while that from fertilizer declined by 6% q-o-q. Sharp fall in spot LNG price to $10-11/mmBtu would accelerate volume recovery and PNGRB amendments to natural gas pipeline tariff allays concern over steep tariff cuts of 15-20%. In addition, the Gujarat state government’s recent policies would support shareholders returns as GSPL has already increased dividend payout to 30% and we see a possibility of share buyback (companies with cash of >Rs. 1,000 crore to exercise buyback) given rising cash on books amid high FCF generation (Rs. 777 crore in FY23).OutlookWe maintain a Buy on GSPL with an unchanged PT of Rs. 342 as core pipeline business is available at only 1.4x FY25E EPS and we expect subsidiary Gujarat Gas volume to also recover given the narrowing down of pricing gap between propane and I-PNG.For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.
