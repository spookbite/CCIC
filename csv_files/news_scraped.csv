"  September 29, 2023 / 09:59 AM IST  ","MC Exclusive | RBI tells PTC India Financial Chairman to fix gaps in governance, operations, compliance  ","The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has written a letter to the chairman of PTC India Financial Services Ltd (PFS), asking the board and the management to pay immediate attention to “critical gaps” in governance, compliance, business, and operational risk discovered in supervisory assessment.Moneycontrol has reviewed the letter dated September 18 which flags concerns based on the inspection report (IR), risk assessment report (RAR), and a supervisory meeting held on September 6.“The supervisory assessment highlights critical gaps in governance and oversight, business risk, compliance culture, operational risk, and IT and cyber security issues. We would like to highlight some of the major supervisory concerns based on the current cycle of ISE (Inspection for Supervisory Evaluation) which may need immediate attention of the board and the MD and CEO of the NBFC,” RBI said.Moneycontrol has sent detailed email queries to PFS and the RBI, seeking their comments on the matter. There has been no response from either.On September 22, 2023, Moneycontrol exclusively reported that RBI’s RAR and IR on PFS, as on March 31, 2022, had found that the company deviated from loan sanction norms and accorded “excessive discretionary power” to a former top official, raising concerns over risk management practices and the robustness of its governance framework.The RBI conducted an off-site assessment and ISE of PFS, under Section 45N of the RBI Act, 1934, from December 7 to 21, 2022. Based on this, the RAR and IR were sent to the company on August 17, 2023.The story so farPTC, which was set up in 1999 as a public-private partnership, is part-owned by state run-power companies — NTPC, Power Grid Corporation of India, Power Finance Corporation of India, and NHPC each own 4.05 percent stake. Life Insurance Corporation owns 5.96 percent and Damodar Valley Corporation owns 3.38 percent in PTC.PFS is the non-banking financial arm of PTC India (formerly Power Trading Corporation), which is partly owned by state run-power companies. The non-banking finance company (NBFC) has been mired in controversy since January 2022, when three independent directors resigned citing corporate governance issues.Since then, RBI and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) have been probing the company. The Registrar of Companies (ROC), an office under the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, on June 27, issued three separate adjudication orders penalising PFS and former Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Pawan Singh, after finding their actions in violation of the Companies Act, 2013.Separately, SEBI issued a show cause notice on May 8 to PTC India Chairman Rajib Mishra (also chairman of PFS) and Pawan Singh for alleged corporate governance lapses at PFS. SEBI held Mishra and Singh responsible for corporate governance lapses due to their influence within PFS.Singh was sent on leave at the end of June on an RBI directive. Mishra’s appointment as CMD of parent company PTC was approved on June 28, backed by state-run shareholders, despite regulatory scrutiny of the process.Irregularities in appointmentsIn the letter, RBI points out that irregularities were observed in the appointment of the company secretary and independent directors.This refers to the findings of the RAR regarding the appointment of the company secretary on  November 17. This appointment was done by an independent committee despite objections from the Nomination and Remuneration Committee (NRC). The appointment was done by diluting the job specifications as against the specifications in the advertisement, and candidates were called for interview at short notice, RBI said.RBI’s RAR also highlights that the appointment of fresh independent directors was placed before  the board at a meeting on June 25th as an additional agenda. At the time, independent directors had objected that this had been done in haste and on a day when one of the independent directors was on leave. Despite two independent directors conveying strong objections and voting against the agenda,  the chairman of the committee and the management voted in favour.Board review and actionRBI has directed the board to review the governance issues highlighted in the resignation letters of the independent directors who resigned in January 2022, and thereafter in November and December 2022. Additionally, the central bank has also asked them to look into irregularities in appointments, excessive powers granted to the MD and CEO, and delays in finalising annual accounts.RBI has asked the company to put in place better management of non-performing assets and strengthen the information systems for informed decision-making. Referring to the concerns over “excessive discretionary powers” given to the former MD and CEO, RBI has directed the board to review these powers and define accountability in the loan sanctioning process.The RBI letter includes a draft Risk Mitigation Plan (RMP) with timelines to address the identified concerns, and requests the company to conduct a board meeting within 30 days to discuss these matters and provide item-wise compliance / comments.",NTPC Ltd.
"  September 29, 2023 / 01:51 AM IST  ",Daily Voice | Have green products and services theme on the radar; this analyst explains why,"Unmesh Sharma, Head of Institutional Equities at HDFC Securities, believes that renewable energy (RE) and electric vehicles will play a significant role in India's energy ecosystem. He sees this as an opportunity of a decade and recommends long-term investors keep it on their radar. According to HDFC Securities, NTPC is their top pick from the power sector to capitalise on this trend.Unmesh with more than 18 years of experience in the capital markets says they are cautious about the equity markets at the current levels as the headline index valuations are above the historic average. Sustained rise in crude price and weakness in key export markets add downside risk to corporate earnings moving forward, he feels.Do you think green products and services will be a big theme to play?We have an unequivocal view that renewable energy (RE) and electric vehicles representing green products and services are poised to play a huge role in the Indian energy ecosystem. RE generation capacity is expected to rise four-fold (96GW to 436 GW) by 2030 aided by stringent renewable power obligation (RPO) standards and decarbonisation efforts across markets. This will lead to augmented investments towards green hydrogen and the introduction of innovative alternative solutions such as energy storage systems, solar modules & electrolysers.We believe this RE growth story will require a mammoth Rs 20 trillion of funding to fuel the capex needed over the next decade for powering an ecosystem of 436 GW RE capacity. Moreover, electric vehicle foray of Indian players can scale up to significance if credible availability of Lithium as a fuel could be ensured.Also read | The F&O edge: Why Zerodha will sit pretty at topOverall, this is a decadal opportunity which should be on every long-term investor’s radar. Our pick from the power sector to play this theme is ""NTPC"".Are railway and defence sectors looking overbought now?As highlighted in our recent capex report, railways and defence sectors have been prime beneficiaries of the ongoing government’s strategy of investment-led growth in the country. We believe the order book growth and execution figures of these companies will continue to remain robust. Hence, from an earnings growth perspective, these sectors remain attractive, however, valuations are stretched for most of the stocks in these segments.So, we would advise a cautious approach towards investing in these stocks and wait for a moderation in valuations for a fresh entry. Among our coverage universe stocks, we see ""Bharat Forge"" getting benefitted from defence sector tailwinds.Do you see bottom-up opportunities in the pharma space from here on? Do you expect more deals like Glenmark in the space in the coming quarters?We have a positive view of the pharma sector as the segment offers various promising bottom-up ideas with strong earnings growth at moderate valuations. Healthy sales of limited competition products coupled with ease of pricing pressure are expected to support growth in US generics.Also read: Why Indian market is holding up better than global peers? S Naren explainsFurther, growth momentum will be led by niche launches. Moreover, domestic formulations are reflecting growth across therapies adding to optimism. We prefer ""Cipla"" from this space.Do you really feel the best way to play the current bull market is through financial space? Do you see multiple opportunities in the same space?While the financial sector remains a long-term proxy to play Indian markets, in the medium term, our preferred space to play the current bull market happens to be the industrial and capital goods sector. The stocks in this space are beneficiaries of India's infrastructure improvement and expansion push, a long-term structural theme.These stocks have run up a great deal over the past 6-12 months as earnings and expectations have been propelled by the ongoing CAPEX cycle in the economy. Due to the sharp rise, valuations in the space are currently quite stretched, thereby limiting capital appreciation in the short to medium term.Also read: NSE's plan to extend trading hours: Additional session to see lower volumes, higher volatilityWhile there is a structural story being played out in the space, it is not prudent to enter these stocks at their current levels. Investors must either look for value picks or be patient and wait for valuations to correct. Our top pick from this sector is ""L&T"".Q: What are the external headwinds for credit growth in the banking space?We believe that the strongest headwind to credit growth currently is the possible deposit growth moderation going forward. The increased propensity of Indian households to invest in financial assets such as Mutual Funds, Life Insurance funds, etc. means a higher competition for banks to attract deposits. Additionally, the loan servicing obligations of the ~25 percent increase in total system credit over the past 18 months, will decrease the percentage of income that households can potentially save.These factors can be possible deterrents to deposit growth in the future. Another risk factor to credit growth can possibly be asset quality headwinds in the system. While the overall banking system is currently healthy, very early signs of stress can be seen around, specifically in the unsecured retail space.If the NPAs for the system start inching up gradually, banks might tighten their credit filters, thereby slowing down credit growth. We prefer ""ICICI Bank"" among banks, given their deposit mobilization capability.Is it time to be cautious about the equity markets after the recent peak seen by the benchmark indices?We are cautious regarding the equity markets at the current levels. The headline index Nifty is currently trading at ~19x FY25 earnings which is above its historic average, indicating that any incremental gains from here must come from improving earnings.Sustained rise in crude price and weakness in key export markets add downside risk to corporate earnings moving forward. Given the current underlying variables, we remain careful about the equity markets in the short to medium term.Do you see more downside in the midcap and smallcap segments?The underlying macro-variables do not support current elevated valuation levels for the midcap and smallcap segments. There is a resurgence of uncertainty surrounding input prices, as seen by increasing crude oil prices over the past month. Corporate earnings of smaller companies are threatened more by input cost inflation as they typically do not have enough pricing power to pass on the costs to their consumers.The looming threat to corporate earnings, coupled with above-average valuations, make us watchful while investing in mid and small-cap space currently. Relatively, between these two categories, we prefer smallcaps (trading at 24x 1-year forward earnings) to midcaps (trading at 29x 1-year forward earnings).Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

However, globally there is a 20 percent drop. India continues to be strong despite the cooling of post-Covid bounce because of the strong domestic consumption. For B2B (business-to-business) tech brands, they have a dependence on overseas sales and this is where the global economy has been impacted more whereas India has continued to grow. Even within technology, global is down by 23 percent and India tech is down by 14 percent.

""Indian brands are significant value creators for our economy.

Instead of going to college, he began his career at a young age by joining his father’s small aluminium conductor business.At the age of 19, he had set out for the city of dreams -- Mumbai – where he began collecting scrap metal from cable companies and selling them. This earned him a good profit over time and he acquired his first company in 1976 by using all his savings and seeking help from friends and family.Copper manufacturer Shamsher Sterling Corporation, the company he acquired, was at the brink of bankruptcy at the time.  For the next 10 years, the mining whiz ran both businesses side by side before setting up a factory – Sterlite Industries -- in 1986. Soon, he realised he would have to contain the input cost and decided to start manufacturing the requisite metals himself instead of purchasing them. In 1993, Sterlite Industries became the first Indian private sector company to smelt copper.Over the next few years, he acquired several other companies such as Madras Aluminium, Bharat Aluminium Company (51 percent stakes), and state-run Hindustan Zinc Limited (HZL). It is these acquisitions that set Agarwal on the path to become a metal and mining magnate.In 2003, Anil Agarwal set up Vedanta Resources in London to tap in global capital. However, Vedanta had to deal with a string of bad luck with environment activists opposing his mining excavations. To add to it, the Centre had revoked Vedanta’s clearance to mine bauxite in 2010. His oil and gas business had suffered too, with the UPA government at the Centre denying him permission to expand Vedanta’s oil field in Rajasthan. During the same time, there was a slump in the international commodities market, prompting Agarwal to pull out of LSE in 2018 and making the company private.Over the next few years, Agarwal’s Vedanta acquired several mines across the globe and also made a foray into the semiconductor business.However, Anil Agarwal’s illustrious life does not stop at his achievements. A philanthrope, the Executive Chairman of Vedanta Resources Plc and the Chairman Emeritus of Vedanta Limited has reportedly vowed to donate most of his wealth to charity. That apart, he has made several donations over the years for the advancement of healthcare and education and also established the Vedanta Foundation.",Vedanta Ltd.
