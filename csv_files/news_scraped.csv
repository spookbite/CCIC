As a result, at 10.59 am, shares of Gland Pharma were trading at Rs 1,670 on the NSE, up 3.8 percent from the previous close. The stock had hit its day's high of Rs 1,768.00 earlier in the session.Gland Pharma reported a 41 percent increase in revenue for the April-June quarter, which brokerages see as an early sign of revival in its base business.Nonetheless, high depreciation and finance costs and weak operating margins dragged the drugmaker's bottomline 15.3 percent lower on-year to Rs 194.1 crore during the quarter under review.Follow our live blog for all the market actionRegardless of the weak bottomline, brokerages feel the 21 percent sequential recovery in the US market hints towards a point of turnaround for the drugmaker.Foreign brokerage Bernstein also seconded the view and believes revenues in the quarter gone by grew as the drugmaker consolidated two months of sales from its recently acquired Cenexi CMO in the European Union. Likewise, Jefferies also feels the improving pricing environmentin the US, momentum in new launches and roadmap for turnaround of Cenexi CMO indicate that worst is likely over for Gland Pharma.Moreover, Bernstein also pointed out that growth was seen in Gland Pharma's topline even after excluding contributions from Cenexi, backed by support from Europe, Rest of the World and India markets. The firm also saw some positives arising from Gland's performance in the US, namely, the rise in volumes for key products like Esmolol ( used to treat fast heartbeat and high blood pressure during medical procedures) and Caspofungin (a lipopeptide antifungal drug).Consequently, Bernstein retained its 'outperform' call on Gland Pharma with a price target of Rs 1,742. Jefferies was even more bullish on the stock, upgrading it to a 'buy' while raising its target price for the stock by 54 percent to Rs 1,640.Jefferies also increased its FY25-26 earnings-per-stock estimates by 5-7 percent as it pegged EPS CAGR (Compounded Annual Growth Rate) of 17 percent for Gland Pharma over FY23-26. Improving base business outlook, margin profile, stable pricing environment and possibilities of new business opportunities through Cenexi are reasons attributed by the brokerage for its bullish stance on the drugmaker.A similar optimism was shown by Motilal Oswal Financial Services as the firm also raised its earnings estimates by 8.5 percent/5.0 percent for FY24/FY25 to factor in a faster revival of the lost business by adding new customers, price stability in the base portfolio, and increase in milestone income.MOFSL not only sees the drugmaker on track to revive its base business but also to increase its offerings in newer markets like China, build a niche pipeline for regulated markets, and enhance the scope of synergy from Cenexi acquisition. The broking house has a 'buy' call on the stock with a price target of Rs 1,560.Another brokerage, Kotak Institutional Equities also sees green shoots of recovery from the company's improved performance of its base business on a sequential basis. Though the firm takes notice of the persisting concerns about the long-term growth and margin outlook, it highlighted that unlike its commentary in May this year, when Gland’s management had limited visibility on client-specific challenges among other issues, the company has now alluded to having greater visibility on the demand front.""In addition, higher confidence in the margin trajectory of the base business augurs well,"" KIE stated in its report. Taking confidence from the management's change in stance, KIE also upgraded the stock to 'reduce' from the earlier 'sell' along with a near 21 percent increase in its target price to Rs 1,300.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

"  August 09, 2023 / 09:06 AM IST  ",Hindalco keeps brokerages upbeat with June quarter earnings,"Brokerages remained bullish on Hindalco Industries Ltd and raised its target price after its better-than-expected earnings for the June quarter.Brokerage firm JM Financial has upheld its 'buy' rating on the stock and raised its target price by 21 percent to Rs 550 per share. The firm expressed that the stock continues to be its favourite within the metals space.Motilal Oswal Securities maintained the 'buy' rating and increased its target price to Rs 550 a share, up 21 percent from current market price. Jefferies India upped the target price by 26 percent to Rs 575, while Antique stock broking raised its target price to Rs 526 and maintained the 'buy' rating.Hindalco reported a 9 percent on-year decrease in consolidated revenue for the first quarter of FY24, amounting to Rs 53,000 crore. This surpassed analysts' expectations by 12 percent, as their estimate stood at Rs 47,500 crore. The company also experienced a 32 percent on-year drop in consolidated EBITDA, reaching Rs 5,700 crore, but this still exceeded analysts' projections by 10 percent, compared to their estimate of Rs 5,200 crore.The company's net profit took a hit, declining by 40 percent to Rs 2,500 crore, yet it managed to surpass analysts' estimates by 22 percent, which were at Rs 2,000 crore. This improvement was primarily driven by increased other income, although it was somewhat offset by higher interest costs and tax expenditure.The company has reported that the Chakla mine is progressing according to its established timeline and is anticipated to commence operations by FY26. Notably, the company has also achieved success in acquiring the Meenakshi West mine, which has the potential to yield approximately 6-7 million tonnes of coal annually. Looking ahead to FY24, the projected capital expenditure (capex) for both India operations and Novelis is estimated to be Rs 4,500 crore.Analysts hold the belief that Hindalco will sustain its positive momentum due to several factors. These factors include the confidence in Novelis achieving its medium-term EBITDA-per-tonne target of $525 by the fourth quarter of FY24, the steadfast performance of Hindalco's aluminum operations in India, strengthened coal security resulting from the acquisition of the Meenakshi and Chakla coal mines, as well as the growth-focused capital expenditure aimed at expanding capacity in the downstream business segment.Analysts hold the perspective that Hindalco exhibits a robust outlook for long-term opportunities. Their confidence is anchored in the company's leadership position in both the beverages can and automotive markets. This optimism is fuelled by the company's strong performance, driven by factors such as sturdy domestic demand, increased demand from electric vehicles and consumer durables sectors, elevated investments in infrastructure and construction, as well as heightened public and private sector capital expenditures.As a result, Motilal Oswal Securities has raised their estimates for FY25 EBITDA and net profit by 4 percent and 10 percent, respectively.According to Antique Stock Broking, enhanced performance in the copper segment, improved aluminum operations (driven by increased downstream volume from the new 34 KT Silvassa extrusion facility and an ongoing additional expansion of 350 KT through debottlenecking at the Utkal Alumina), reduced coal expenses, and progress in enhancing Novelis' operations are expected to contribute to an uplift in profitability.",Hindalco Industries Ltd.

Brokerages have downgraded Hindustan Unilever stock from a ‘buy’ rating to a ‘hold’ or ‘neutral’ rating.Prabhudas Lilladher downgraded its rating on Hindustan Unilever to ‘hold’ from ‘accumulate’ before. The downgrade was done factoring in tepid volume growth in the food and refreshment and personal wash segments in the April-to-June quarter.Also Read: HUL Q1 disappoints on weak demand, volume growth at 3%The domestic brokerage firm said that HUL’s price cut strategy to compete with local players will diminish in the longer run. This means that the excitement around lower prices will fade away gradually as people get used to the new prices, making it less effective in the long run. Rural markets have, however, started to improve. Prabhudas Lilladher expects erratic weather conditions to increase inflation in daily use items and disrupt Hindustan Unilever’s volume recovery path.Yes Securities has cut its rating on Hindustan Unilever to ‘neutral’ from ‘add’ earlier and revised the target price to Rs 2,890. The brokerage firm sees limited upside on the stock in anticipation of a slower volume growth in coming quarters.Yes Securities said that even tough rural markets are showing improvement and that demand in rural areas will come back slowly as people are still using the high priced inventory in the market. Resurgence of small players and reducing stock levels in anticipation of further input price cuts will also lead to slower volume growth for Hindustan Unilever.TitanTitan had 27 buy calls in July, and now has 23. Phillip Capital has downgraded the stock to ‘neutral’ from ‘buy’ earlier and revised the target price to Rs 3,100. Phillip Capital expects increased advertising spends to lower margins further as Titan is investing on above-the-line and below-the-line activities to increase its market share. Above-the-line usually refers to costs above the gross profit, which includes cost of goods sold -- cost of raw materials, wages, other facilities costs which go into producing the goods. Below-the-line expenses include operating expenses, interest and taxes.Also Read: Titan Q1 results: Net profit falls 4.3% to Rs 756 crore; revenue up 26%, misses estimatesThe brokerage firm expects consumer demand to moderate on account of higher gold prices and pent-up demand. The brokerage firm believes that Titan has rich valuations and the stock does not see any meaningful appreciation.Another brokerage DART has cut its rating for Titan to ‘sell’ with a target price of Rs 2,980 as it believes the stock has become expensive. The brokerage firm said, “Although Titan’s Q1 profitability was lower than estimates, we maintain our FY24-25 Earnings Per Share estimates at Rs 42.5 in FY24 and 48.5 in FY25 as we believe that the profitability going ahead would improve significantly.”Asian PaintsAsian Paints now have 12 buy calls, down from 15 in July. Axis Securities has cut the rating to ‘hold’ from ‘buy’ earlier and revised the target price to Rs 3,500. The brokerage firm believes the stock has limited upside potential in the near-term as competition from the new entrants is likely to intensify. And this will keep the profitability under check. However, Axis Securities is positive on the long-term prospects of the company.Also Read: Asian Paints net profit jumps 52% on double‐digit volume growth in Indian decorative businessPrabhudas Lilladher has cut the rating from ‘accumulate’ to ‘hold’ earlier, given the EPS valuations of 53.5x in FY25 and increased competition from Grasim and JSW in coming years.

"  August 09, 2023 / 09:42 AM IST  ",Tomato farmers are crushing Nifty companies in profitability,"“The farmer is the only man in our economy who buys everything at retail, sells everything at wholesale, and pays the freight both ways.” - John Fitzgerald KennedyA visit to the vegetable market right now can be an exercise in self-flagellation. Shelling out three-digit prices for kitchen staples is an economic stress test for most household budgets, but at the other end of the spectrum, it is nothing but cosmic justice for the country’s much-suffering farmers.The agriculture sector in India is synonymous with generating a steady stream of gloomy headlines.The same was the case at the onset of summer this year, when growers in Nashik and some other markets were seen dumping their tomato produce on the streets after prices at the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) mandis slumped to a mere Rs 1.5 per kg due to a supply glut.Driven by frustration and saddled with debt, a lot of the cultivators had completely shifted to planting other crops.However, those who stayed on with the crop are reaping the bounty of Lady Luck’s benevolent gaze.In fact, such drastic has been the reversal of fortunes that the per-unit economics of tomato is currently among the most lucrative in the country.TomatonomicsAs expected in a market as vast and diverse as India, the tomato business has wide variations in terms of financial metrics.The cost of cultivation can range from Rs 4 per kg to more than Rs 20, depending on factors like proximity to the market, agent commissions and labour charges.However, even at the upper end of the input cost range, farmers are making a killing with retail prices ruling above Rs 200 per kg.Hari Narayan Reddy, who owns big farms in Chikkaballapur near Bengaluru, said cultivators are getting around ten-times the usual rate for their produce.“A 15-kg crate is going upwards of Rs 2,000 here. Good quality tomatoes are fetching even higher. The farmer has to pay around 10 percent of this for agent commission, labour cost, transport charges etc,” he told Moneycontrol.In terms of input costs, a farmer spends around Rs 1-1.5 lakh per acre of tomato cultivation, depending on his financial position. An acre yields around 2,500 boxes, which can go up to 3,000 in case of a bumper crop.“Most tomato cultivators have become crorepatis beginning July. But we must remember they also incurred heavy losses earlier this year,” he added.For farmers who are not selling at APMC mandis and are going directly to wholesale markets, the per-kg cost is even lower as they save on the agent commission. But even with the commission and other attendant overheads, tomato farmers are operating at profit margins which the crème de la crème of Corporate India would be proud of.According to data from ACE Equities, the highest operating profit margin for a company on Nifty 100 stood at 90.58 percent in FY23 (Bajaj Holdings & Investment).Others in the top-5 included HDFC AMC (89.21 percent), Power Grid (88.86 percent), Muthoot Finance (78.39 percent) and Adani Green Energy (76.03 percent).Marquee names like TCS, SBI, HUL, Dabur and Bajaj Auto are functioning below the 30 percent operating profit margin range. A dozen firms posted profit margins in single digits.The Remnants Prajapati, a 27-year-old farmer, is currently camped in a tent under a flyover in Delhi’s Mayur Vihar with his family and scores of others. The recent spell of heavy rains in North India and the consequent flooding of the Yamuna has inundated his 5-acre farm, making him a homeless in his home town. “Forget tomatoes, I would have got good prices even for other vegetables like onion and capsicum. But how can we escape what fate has in store?” he rued.Prajapati's is not an isolated case.The freakish weather events this year – ranging from severe heatwaves to record-shattering rains – coupled with rising incidence of pest attacks have played havoc with farmers.Also Read: Vegetarian thali costs 28% more in July than June as tomato prices shoot upIn the case of tomatoes, which are highly perishable and sensitive to water and temperature variations, floods in Himachal Pradesh and pest attacks in Karnataka’s Kolar region – both major producers of the crop – resulted in a severe supply crunch, pushing prices skywards.But only those farmers who managed to escape Mother Nature’s fury are profiting from the high prices.The current situation in tomato is like a lottery, says Gunvant Patil Hangargekar, general secretary of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee.“After the terribly low prices at the start of this season, many farmers stopped planting tomatoes altogether. Then in the monsoons, excess rainfall flooded most farms. For example, in Nanded (in Maharashtra), there was around 75 percent excess rainfall, which destroyed the tomato crops. Only the lucky few who survived both these situations are making profits now, and even they had to bear steep losses in the previous seasons,” Hangargekar told Moneycontrol.Peer behind all the recent headlines on tomato farmers minting millions, and we are confronted with a harsh truth – agriculture is fundamentally a high-risk, low-returns enterprise for the majority of small and medium cultivators.Devinder Sharma, a noted agricultural expert, almost loses his cool when asked about tomato farmers’ windfall gains this year.“Did you ask them their profit margins when they were receiving Re 1 per kg? Did you ask them their cost of production when they were forced to borrow money at exorbitant rates? If they are making money now, why so much heartburn among the middle-class?” he told Moneycontrol.The heartburn, perhaps, stems from the fact that the middle-class taxpayer ends up footing the bill for all calamities, whether local or global. Or maybe because while prices shoot up immediately in the aftermath of any disruption, they take their own sweet time to cool off, if at all.But those stories are for another time.For now, let us cheer the humble tomato grower having his moment in the sun.Also Read: A letter from humble Tomato to the RBI Governor",Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd.
