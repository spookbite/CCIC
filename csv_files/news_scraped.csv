Bajaj Auto (BJAUT) 1Q revenue (Rs. 103bn) was largely in-line, while EBITDA margin (19.0%) was higher than PLe (18%) but in-line with street estimates (19%). EBITDA margins saw slight decline QoQ on de-inventorisation, inferior mix and better vehicle mix, offset by higher operating leverage. However, strong cost control of employee expenses and other operating expense, shielded from a steeper decline. Export volumes recovered QoQ and BJAUT is expecting gradual improvement, given macro challenges in those markets. The company will also face increasing pressure from inferior mix as the export portfolio from African regions begins to increase (higher mix of low margin products) plus increase in EV volumes and margins are likely to remain at current levels. 2Q volumes in domestic market could be soft due to high base.OutlookWe expect BJAUT’s domestic premium segment volumes to grow (similar to the industry) helped by premiumisation trends besides fast ramp-up of EVs could make us turn constructive on the stock.

The demerger structure is intended to facilitate pure play growth, ensuring a focused and specialized path forward.As part of the growth strategy, ITC aims to facilitate Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs) and nurture investment opportunities, which will be boosted with ITC’s brand name, said Chairman Sanjiv Puri in the investor call on July 27.ITC Limited had announced in a regulatory filing on July 24 that its board has given initial approval for the separation of its hotel business via a scheme of arrangement. This restructuring plan is expected to allow the hotel division to operate independently in the fast-growing hospitality market, focusing on growth with an ideal capital structure.Speaking about financials of both ITC and the demerged business, Chairman Sanjiv Puri said, financial ratios will certainly improve substantially. For ITC, the new entity will be folded as an associate and goes out of the segment capital employed in the balance sheet. The 20 percent capital employed comprising of hotels business will not be present, he added.The segment ROCE (return on capital employed) ratio should improve by 18-20 percentage points, said Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Supratim Dutta. ROIC (return on invested capital) is expected to improve double-digits by 10 percentage points. This is based on current financials and is a ballpark figure, he added.""The company is well equipped to raise capital,"" said Puri. It is going to be more of a situation where it will be asset light with less capital, he added.The capital employed in hotel business is around Rs 6,000 crore in net assets with no debt, said Dutta. This will help the new entity to raise capital going forward but the new entity will have to leverage its own balance sheet, he added.""All the assets, employee and operating companies will move to the new company broadly,"" said Puri.Talking about the employees, Puri said, ITC's ongoing support for the new hotel business will provide a stable base for the employees. The same basic values and company culture will carry over, so employees shouldn't worry about that. Plus, ITC has a habit of letting managers move around different departments, which means staff have a chance to use their skills in various settings.ITC also has a special stock option plan for certain employees. When these employees move to the new company, the details of this plan will be worked out by the new company. But one thing is clear: the benefits for employees who transfer, including those going to the hotel business, will be just as good, if not better, than the benefits they have now at ITC. The whole idea behind the transition process is to make sure no employee ends up worse off because of the change, he added.Talking about future demergers, Puri said the company always make decisions that are best for long-term growth. It all depends on the business plan, how the industry is changing, and where the company is in their own  development. Every option has its advantages and disadvantages. The company needs to look at both and decide which setup will make the business stronger. The company's analysis will guide their actions. This method is what led them to consider a different structure for the hotel business in 2019-20, he added.",ITC Ltd.

However, brokerages have retained their bullish outlook on the stock, given the company's brand, distribution and cost advantage.APE or Annualised premium equivalent is a measure of new business written by a life insurance company. The Street had expected SBI Life's APE to grow 10 percent to Rs 3,177.5 crore, however, it came in at Rs 3,030 crore.Follow our live blog for all the market action""SBI Life reported muted Q1 APE growth but its four-year CAGR of 12.7 percent is much higher than HDFC Life's 8 percent and significantly superior to ICICI Pru Life's 0.1 percent,"" said Nuvama Institutional Equities.VNB or Value of New Business for the quarter fell 1 percent on-year to Rs 870 crore, which was also below estimates of Rs 973 crore. VNB margin declined to 28.8 percent from 30.4 percent in the year-ago period.The fall in margins was primarily due to weakness in the non-par segment. Non-participating policies, which fetch higher margins for life insurers, have seen cool-off in demand post new tax regulations.The company's product mix moved back towards ULIPs or Unit Linked Investment Products — a combination of insurance plus investment — which does not enjoy juicy margins.In the earnings concall, the management maintained the guidance of better-than-industry premium growth and a range-bound VNB margin of 28-30 percent.The management also acknowledged that in the near term, product-level margins are probably at optimum levels and the mix will be a key driver for the margin trajectory.On the distribution front, bancassurance is still the dominant channel with an APE mix share of 65 percent, up 2.8 percentage points on-year, while agency channel saw a decline in its share to 25 percent, given non-par savings is the dominant product in this segment.On the back of this, Nuvama Institutional Equities has cut its FY24/25 VNB estimates by 3.8 percent/4.6 percent. However, it has retained its target price on the stock at Rs 1,600 with a 'buy' rating.""A growth vector for SBI Life is its parent SBI (23,000 branches) and strong agency force (2,22,000).
