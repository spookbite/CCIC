"  September 04, 2023 / 09:43 AM IST  ",Which were the top performing bluechips in August? Look inside your kitchen,"For traders starved of action in this sideways market, a stroll through their kitchen might turn out to be nothing less than an adrenaline-soaked adventure. Or even a lesson in diversification.Just as prices of tomatoes and other vegetables have started to cool off, it is the turn of pulses to make a splash.As per data from agri-commodities exchange NCDEX, spot prices of chana soared over 22 percent in August, while that of moong climbed nearly 13 percent.In contrast, the top performer in the Nifty pack during the month was Tech Mahindra at 7.7 percent, followed by Cipla (6.92 percent) and M&M (6.79 percent).Not just that, even a commodity like barley has outperformed all but one Nifty constituent in August. Kitchen staple wheat too has beaten 43 of the 50 Nifty stocks in terms of monthly performance.Reading the PulseWith all the action seemingly shifting to the kitchen and vegetable mandis, does this mean equity investors should start looking at agri-commodities as an investible asset class?Market experts are not so sure.“Diversification is a must for investors, but I don’t think agri-commodities are the way to go. Firstly, the lot sizes are very big in this segment, which makes it unfeasible for a majority of retail investors.“Secondly, since futures trade in agri-commodities like pulses and oilseeds is currently banned by the government, the only way for retail investors to participate is physical purchase from mandis and storing in warehouses etc, which again is not suitable for the common investor,” Manoj Kumar Jain, Head- Commodity & Currency Research at Prithvi Finmart, told Moneycontrol.Retail participation in this segment can be promoted through steps like launching agri ETFs, as has been done for commodities like gold and silver, Jain said.Futures trading is allowed for agricultural products like turmeric, coriander, castor seed, cotton, among others.Besides, options trading was started a few years back for agri items like guar seed and guar gum, but the volumes are very low at the moment, which again is a roadblock for retail investors, he added.Lentil prices have been on the boil this year despite several interventions by the government. Erratic monsoon rains in major growing states like Maharashtra and Karnataka coupled with falling acreage have led to a supply squeeze, driving prices northwards.Sambhar with chana dal, anyone? Govt wants you to ditch expensive tur for cheaper alternativeSeeking to rein in prices, the Centre in January this year announced an extension of the duty-free import policy for tur and urad till March 31, 2024. The government on June 2 this year also imposed stock limits on the two pulses allowing traders to keep only limited amount of stocks and offload the remaining.Looking to shift consumption for those who cannot afford the expensive arhar, the Centre on August 9 launched chana dal as ‘Bharat Dal’ in retail packs of Rs 60 per kg.Agri FuturesWhile equity and debt segments hog the majority of headlines, organised futures trading in agricultural commodities has a nearly 150-year long history in India.The Bombay Cotton Trade Association was set up in 1875 to trade cotton derivatives contracts. In the following years, institutions for futures trade in oilseeds and foodgrains like wheat and rice were formed.Futures trade in a variety of farm commodities flourished between the first and second world wars, but post-Independence, alleged manipulations in prices forced the government to ban most farm futures trade.Agriculture has always been a politically sensitive topic in India, and futures trading in the sector has repeatedly been blamed for price manipulation, inflation and a host of other ills.However, many experts maintain the segment has been unfairly targeted, and that the futures market actually helps farmers in risk management as they can pre-fix the sale price of their produce, while buyers too can be assured of stable supplies at a pre-determined price.The latest ban on futures trading in agri commodities came in 2021 when the Centre suspended nine farm futures initially for a year and then extended by another year until December 2023.In December last year, industry body Commodity Participants Association of India (CPAI) had urged the government and Sebi to allow exchanges to resume trading in agricultural derivatives contracts.The association suggested that increasing margin and lowering open interest limits for commodity derivatives contracts may be resorted to in case significant volatility is observed in agri-commodity derivatives.",Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd.

While the Nifty has gained 0.88 percent last week, the stock has gained a healthy 12 percent. In the process, the stock has closed above its recent trading range on the back of above average volumes, which augurs well for the uptrend to continue.Technical indicators are giving positive signals as the stock is trading above the 20 and 50-day SMA (simple moving average). Momentum readings like the 14-week RSI (relative strength index), too, are in rising mode and not overbought, which implies potential for further upsides.With the intermediate technical setup too looking attractive, we expect the stock to move up towards its previous intermediate highs in the coming weeks. One can buy between Rs 728-732 levels, with a stop-loss at Rs 655 and target of Rs 880.Laxmi Organic Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 298 | Stop-Loss: Rs 264 | Target: Rs 370 | Return: 24 percentAfter touching a low of Rs 220 in March 2023, Laxmi Organic has gradually climbed higher and made higher tops and higher bottoms. Last week, the stock has broken out of its recent trading range on the back of above average volumes. Intermediate momentum readings like the 14-week RSI too are in rising mode and not overbought. This augurs well for the uptrend to continue.With the intermediate technical setup, too, looking positive, we believe the stock has the potential to move higher in the coming weeks. We recommend a buy between Rs 296-300 levels, with a stop-loss at Rs 264 and target of Rs 370.Fine Organics Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 4,817 | Stop-Loss: Rs 4,530 | Target: Rs 5,300 | Return: 10 percentAfter correcting from an intermediate high of Rs 5,809 tested in January 2023, Fine Organics found support around Rs 4,040 levels in March 2023. These are strong supports as they also roughly coincide with previous intermediate lows.The stock has since then been climbing higher and making higher bottoms in the process. This week, the stock also broke out of its recent trading range on the back of healthy volumes, indicating it is set to move higher in the coming weeks.Technical indicators are giving positive signals as the stock is trading above the 20 and 50-day SMA. Momentum readings like the 14-week RSI too are in rising mode and not overbought, which implies potential for further upsides.With the intermediate technical setup too looking attractive, we expect the stock to move up towards its previous intermediate highs in the coming weeks. Buy between Rs 4,820-4,830 levels, with a stop-loss at Rs 4,530 and target of Rs 5,300.Expert: Viraj Vyas, CMT, technical & derivatives analyst - institutional equity at Ashika Stock BrokingLTIMindtree: Buy | LTP: Rs 5,303 | Stop-Loss: Rs 5,090 | Target: Rs 5,950 | Return: 12 percentFollowing its impressive performance in the wake of the March 2020 rally, the stock experienced a significant downturn amid the broader IT sell-off in early 2022. However, starting from June 2022, both the stock and the entire IT sector have been engaged in a consolidation phase, characterized by a positive bias. This suggests that the phase of price correction has reached its conclusion.Of late, there has been a notable breakout above Rs 5,300 levels, accompanied by a pattern of forming higher lows. These developments are clear indicators of mounting buyer enthusiasm.Maruti Suzuki India: Buy | LTP: Rs 10,331 | Stop-Loss: Rs 9,900 | Target: Rs 11,600 | Return: 12 percentThe stock has lagged its peers in the automotive sector for some time. However, it appears that the stock has finally concluded a 5.5-year period of time and price correction. This is evident as its price has now surpassed the levels seen in 2018.Since the beginning of this year, the stock has been exhibiting a pattern of higher highs and higher lows. Its ability to maintain levels above Rs 10,000-9,900 zone bodes well for potential further bullish momentum.In the near future, the stock may target Rs 12,000, and there's potential for an even larger target of Rs 15,000 in the coming months. This indicates a potentially strong uptrend for the stock.RITES: Buy | LTP: Rs 510 | Stop-Loss: Rs 490 | Target: Rs 575 | Return: 13 percentThe stock has been following a robust price trend since the beginning of this year. What's more, since June, it has experienced significant momentum acceleration, which aligns with a renewed interest in the sector it belongs to.Notably, the stock appears to have broken out of a Flag and Pole pattern on its weekly chart. This breakout suggests that there is potential for further momentum in the stock.In the coming weeks, it's expected that the stock could reach levels around 580-600, indicating a potentially strong upward movement.Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, head of research (retail) at Kotak SecuritiesBandhan Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 235 | Stop-Loss: Rs 225 | Target: Rs 260 | Return: 11 percentSince the stock hit a low of Rs 210, it is making a series of higher bottoms. On a weekly basis, the stock managed to close above all-important averages.Based on the formation, we believe that the stock is headed towards the next resistance, which lies between Rs 255-260 levels. To create any long position, traders need to place the stop-loss at Rs 225.Cummins India: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,706 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,630 | Target: Rs 1,930 | Return: 13 percentOn Friday, the stock made a sharp recovery after taking support near Rs 1,670. The Rs 1,670 level is very relevant, as it is the 61.80 percent retracement of the entire rally, which we saw between Rs 1,480 and Rs 1,980 levels.The stock is also witnessing volume-based activity on both exchanges. It has formed a reversal formation on a daily basis based on candlestick formation. It is a buy at current levels. To maintain a long position keep a stop-loss at Rs 1,630.
