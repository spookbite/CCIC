Blended derived gross marketing margins rose 65% q-o-q to Rs. 4,406/tonne led by positive petrol/diesel margin supported by fall in crude oil price.

We expect earnings to normalise over FY24-25 led by normalisation of crude oil price.

Despite management’s efforts, JLR’s net debt stands reduced by just GBP 200mn in FY23 vs FY22. Going forward, JLR has guided for FCF of >GBP 2bn and a reduction in net debt to GBP1bn in FY24. It is important to highlight that JLR had given a similar 5% margin guidance in FY23, but achieved just under 50% of that. More surprisingly, JLR has refrained from giving any guidance for FY25. Given the geopolitical headwinds and resultant concerns around demand slowdown in its key regions, the current guidance appears highly optimistic to us. Management is also cognizant of demand concerns which can be highlighted by the fact that they expect: (1) demand in H1 to be weak and (2) order book to decline at around 5k per month for H1. In India business, FCF sustenance looks difficult, given: 1) TTMT has lost substantial market share in CVs in FY23 and is likely to focus on recovering lost share soon; (2) demand macro is subdued in PVs and the best model cycle for TTMT is behind; (3) rise in capex.OutlookMaintain REDUCE, with a revised TP of INR457/sh (from INR 415) as we roll forward to FY25 EPS.For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.
