"  March 23, 2023 / 12:31 PM IST  ",Hold GAIL; target of Rs 115: Emkay Global Financial,"Emkay Global Financial's research report on GAILThe company is witnessing a delay in deal renewal, only partial deal renewals, slower decision-making and budget-cut in select clients. Mgmt remains watchful of the macro conditions and expects muted growth in the near term, with hope of recovery in H2CY23. Company has no direct exposure to troubled US regional banks and its exposure to overall US regional banks remains limited. However, eClerx remains exposed to large global banks as well as to investment banks. Management expects adjusted EBITDAM (including other income) to remain at the lower half of the guided range of 28-32% for FY23. Company currently operates at 45-50% WFO and expects no material margin impact, with SEZ rules being relaxed till end-CY23. Near-term revenue growth is likely to be muted amid macro uncertainties and weakness in Digital. Client concentration and potential roll-offs remain risks; however, growth challenges would be short-lived, as medium-term demand drivers remain intact. We have rolled forward our TP to Mar-25E EPS and raised our FY23E-25E EPS by 1.6%-6%, factoring-in the 9MFY23 performance and increasing the INR/USD assumption to 79.9 vs 78.0 for FY23.OutlookGAIL is favorably placed, though the recent stock outperformance prices in most positives. Thus, we downgrade our rating from Buy to Hold, keeping FY25 based TP unchanged at Rs115/sh – although if gas price and capacity appeals are accepted, another 10% tariff hike can accrue (~Rs65/mmbtu), which along with better gas marketing margins (we have built in ~Rs25bn EBITDA) are upside risks (TP goes up by 10% to ~Rs125).For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

"  March 23, 2023 / 11:54 AM IST  ",Buy GAIL; target of Rs 147: Motilal Oswal,"Motilal Oswal's research report on GAILPNGRB, in its tariff order dated 22nd Mar’23, has approved a levelized tariff of INR58.6/mmBtu for GAIL’s integrated natural gas pipeline (INGPL), effective 1st Apr’23. To give a perspective, GAIL had proposed an integrated tariff of INR68/mmBtu v/s ~INR43/mmBtu realized during 9MFY23. As a result of the tariff hike, we increase our EBITDA estimate (excluding other income) for FY24 to INR134b from INR116b previously. Similarly, we raise our FY24 EPS estimate by 16% to INR14.4 from INR12.4 previously. LNG prices have plummeted to ~USD12/mmBtu from the peak of USD54/mmBtu. This correction, combined with the recent ramp-up of PATA, should improve the petrochem segment’s performance.OutlookOwing to these positive factors, we reiterate our BUY rating on the stock. We value the stock at 9x adjusted FY25E EPS and add the value of investments to arrive at a TP of INR147, up from INR127 earlier.For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

"  March 23, 2023 / 08:28 AM IST  ","Short Call: March theory, rising FII shorts, Hindustan Aeronautics, Manappuram Finance, Fed rate hike","“Guessing at the future rate of interest is, in my opinion, one of the most puzzling problems in the world.”  ~ John Maynard KeynesBulls prevailed for the third straight session on Wednesday even as near term outlook on the market remains cautious. Trading volumes are low and institutions too are not showing much interest. One of the popular ‘March’ theories in the market is that mutual funds typically support the prices of their favourite stocks to juice up the net asset value (NAV) for year-end purpose. That is not playing out this time as inflows into equity schemes have slowed down of late. At the same time, many wealthy traders are cutting back on some of their positions to gets their account books in order ahead of the year end.  FII net short positions in index futures have now climbed to 85 percent, surprising, as one would have expected some short covering in a rising market.HALBulls in Hindustan Aeronautics are worried if the stock will go the IRCTC way now that the government has announced its plan for an offer for sale. The floor price for the OFS--3.5 percent stake or roughly 1.17 crore shares—has been fixed at Rs 2450 per share. The market’s long standing complaints about PSUs is that the moment the companies start doing well, there is either some policy change that affects earnings (think ONGC, OIL) or an OFS by the government. IRCTC shares tanked shortly after the OFS at Rs 680 per share in December and since then have traded way below that price. There is a difference though. The internet platform story in the case of IRCTC is no longer hot, and besides the company’s earnings from its main line of business—internet ticketing—is not growing at the same pace as before. In comparison, the defence story with bulging order books and earnings visibility for the next few years still seems to have some steam left. And yet, veteran brokers will tell you that irrespective of how attractive the fundamental story, an excess supply of shares is never a good thing in the short run.Manappuram FinanceThe stock seems to be back in favour with the market now that gold prices are rising. The shares have underperformed over the last three years as banks made inroads into the gold loan segment, the mainstay of Manappuram Finance. For long, it was felt that banks would not be keen on expanding their presence in this business, and even if they did, local NBFCs would do a much better job of it. That assumption turned out to be wrong. Banks got into gold loans in a big way, given the juicy margins, and they offered lower interest rates, forcing NBFCs like Manappuram and Muthoot to do the same. In addition, falling gold prices also led to a spike in defaults by customers. The price war on interest rates has now abated, and high gold prices mean that gold loan firms can lend more against the same quantity of gold. Besides, gold loan firms will be less worried about defaults because they can always sell the jewellery and recover the outstanding dues. Some brokerages have again turned bullish on Manappuram. But the bet could be different this time around. Analysts are not hopeful that the gold loan business alone can change Manappuram Finance fortunes, or any gold loan NBFC for that matter. Banks have demonstrated that they can play the gold loan game as good as the established NBFCs. Those with a bullish view on Manappuram will have to bet that the NBFC will be able to make up for the market share loss in gold loans by performing better in its other line of businesses-commercial vehicle loans, mortgages, SME and personal loans.US markets’ about turnUS markets initially rose as the Federal Reserve hiked rates by 25 basis as expected, but later fell sharply after Fed chair Jerome Powell’s speech. What could have caused the about turn?From CNBC.com“At first, Powell’s reassurances that the “banking system is sound and resilient” continued soothing markets. Then Powell started talking about “tighter credit conditions for households and businesses” which were not reflected in stock indexes since they “don’t necessarily capture lending conditions.” This signaled to markets that the economy could be in a worse place than many had expected.”",Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd.
"  March 23, 2023 / 10:50 AM IST  ",Anil Agarwal said to weigh Vedanta stake sale as last-resort option,"Indian tycoon Anil Agarwal is studying options including selling a minority stake in Vedanta Ltd. as he looks to shrink his commodities business empire’s massive debt load, according to people familiar with the matter.Agarwal is evaluating the possibility of divesting a less than 5% stake in the Mumbai-listed company, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the information is private. Vedanta’s shares have fallen about 32% in the last 12 months, giving it a market value of about $12.6 billion. A 5% stake is worth about $630 million. A stake sale in Vedanta is a last resort for the billionaire and will only be considered if other fundraising options fail, the people said.Agarwal’s Vedanta Resources Ltd., which owns about 70% of Vedanta, has been in talks with at least three banks for a loan of as much as $1 billion, Bloomberg News reported earlier this month. The discussions are ongoing and no final decisions have been made on the loan, the people said.“Any talks of stake sale in Vedanta Ltd. is untrue and baseless,” a representative for the companies said in response to a Bloomberg News query.Vedanta Resources may rely on dividends from its subsidiary Hindustan Zinc Ltd. to help repay the $400 million worth of dollar-denominated bonds due in April, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence report. Hindustan Zinc on Tuesday said it will pay an interim dividend of 26 rupees a share, or a total of about 110 billion rupees ($1.3 billion).Surging interest rates globally have pressured low-rated borrowers with heavy debt loads like Vedanta’s. The Vedanta Group in January agreed to sell a zinc manufacturing business to its subsidiary Hindustan Zinc for $2.98 billion in phases over 18 months. The Indian government, which owns about 30% of Hindustan Zinc, strongly opposed the deal.Vedanta Resources slashed its net debt by $2 billion in the current financial year and will continue to deleverage from net debt of $7.7 billion in the next two financial years, the company said in an exchange filing in February.A self-made billionaire, Agarwal was looking to expand his business empire into a resources conglomerate like BHP Group Ltd. He was the largest shareholder of Anglo American Plc until 2019 when he exited his investment because his returns were “achieved even sooner than expected.” He tried but failed to take the cash-rich Vedanta private in 2020. Agarwal then considered a potential merger of his closely held Vedanta Resources and the Mumbai-traded company, Bloomberg News reported last year.Agarwal built his fortunes on a series of ambitious acquisitions: In 2001, he bought control of then government-owned Bharat Aluminium Co. in one of the first tests of India’s efforts to offload state holdings. He followed that up with the purchase of another government entity, Hindustan Zinc. He successfully bid for what was India’s largest iron ore producer Sesa Goa Ltd. in 2007 and for Cairn India, despite having no oil and gas experience.",Vedanta Ltd.
"  March 23, 2023 / 11:40 AM IST  ",Anil Agarwal denies any intention to sell stake in Vedanta,"Indian billionaire Anil Agarwal has denied any intention of selling his stake in Vedanta. This comes after several media outlets suggested that Agarwal was considering various options, including selling a minority stake in the company, to reduce his business empire's significant debt load.The media reports had stated that Agarwal is examining the possibility of divesting a stake of less than 5% in the Mumbai-listed company.During Thursday's early trading session, Vedanta's shares dropped by up to 6% on the BSE.Last week, Vedanta Resources repaid $250 million in loans that the company took from Barclays Bank and Standard Chartered Bank.The company had earlier said it has enough means to meet debt repayment liabilities in the coming quarters as it looked to assuage investor concerns around its financial position. VRL, the majority owner of Mumbai-listed mining and oil & gas company Vedanta Ltd, repaid USD 150 million borrowed from Barclays Bank.According to an exchange filing made in February, Vedanta has reduced its net debt by $2 billion in the current financial year and plans to continue reducing its debt load over the next two financial years, from a starting point of $7.7 billion.",Vedanta Ltd.
