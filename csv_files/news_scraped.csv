"  May 08, 2023 / 09:55 AM IST  ",TCNS Clothing slumps as shareholders feel deprived over share swap ratio,"Share price of TCNS Clothing plummeted after the company said Aditya Birla Fashion & Retail (ABFRL) would be acquiring controlling stake in the company and launch an open offer to acquire additional stake.ABFRL, which operates Pantaloons, has agreed to purchase a 51 percent stake in TCNS Clothing, a women’s branded apparel company, for Rs 1,650 crore. TCNS Clothing owns popular ethnic brands such as W, Aurelia, Wishful, Folksong and Elleven.ABFRL also plans to make a conditional open offer to buy up to a 29 percent stake at 503 rupees per share from public shareholders and acquire the remaining stake from the founder promoters to reach an overall shareholding of 51 percent in TCNS. This makes it one of the largest deals in the Indian fashion industry.As of 9.20am, TCNS Clothing plunged 17.71 percent to Rs 428.55 following the announcement. Shares of ABFRL, meanwhile, gained 1.77 percent to Rs 218.The companies claim that the acquisition aligns with ABFRL's objective of creating a comprehensive fashion portfolio across various consumer segments and price points.After the 51 percent acquisition, TCNS will be amalgamated with ABFRL under the merger scheme and public shareholders of TCNS will receive 11 shares of ABFRL for every 6 shares that they hold in TCNS.This is where shareholders feel shortchanged and are not happy.Let us do the simple maths. As of Friday, TCNS Clothing’s closing price was Rs 514 per share. Six shares at that price means Rs 3,084. On the other hand, 11 shares of ABFRL amounts to Rs 2,353.This had led to heavy selling in TCNS Clothing shares. On the other hand, ABFRL shareholders are set to be better positioned. For the company, the acquisition comes at a time when the company has been expanding its ethnic and occasion wear portfolio aggressively, to which TCNS will be a good addition.Listen: Britannia Industries Q4, Paytm results & Aditya Birla Fashion's newest acquisition However, one concern that analysts point out is pressure on financial and earning ratios, which was already feeling the pinch of the aggressive expansion.“ABFRL Will see pressure on margins and return ratios,” said Preeyam Toila, Axis Securities. “As they have entered a lot of categories in the last few years.”Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

"  May 08, 2023 / 07:35 AM IST  ","Coal India net profit declines 18% on higher provisions, misses estimates","State-run Coal India Ltd missed Street estimates with the net profit for the fourth quarter declining primarily because of increased provisions towards wages.Coal India reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 5,527.62 crore in the March quarter, down 17.7 percent from a year ago. Consolidated revenue for the quarter stood at Rs 35,161.44 crore, up 17.3 percent year on year.  The Bloomberg poll estimated a net profit of Rs 7,752 crore while revenue was expected at Rs 35,270 crore.The company recommended a final dividend of Rs 4 per share. Earlier in two tranches a total dividend of Rs 20.25 per share was already paid out.CIL's total expenses in the fourth quarter increased to Rs 32,791 crore from Rs 25,140.01 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal.Also read: Bank of India expects advances to grow 11-12% in FY24Employee benefit expenses surged 60 percent YoY to Rs 16,983 crore compared to Rs 12,951 crore of Bloomberg estimates.

Finance cost advanced 61 percent YoY to Rs 195 crore versus Rs 54.96 crore Bloomberg analysts expectations.In January, the coal miner reached an agreement to propose a new wage agreement for its non-executive employees, which is expected to increase the annual wage bill to around Rs 46,000 crore, a likely rise of approximately Rs 6,000 crore.If the provision had not been made, the net profit would have been the highest profit ever recorded in any quarter. Despite capping its coal prices for over five years and facing rising input costs such as diesel and explosives, as well as increased wage costs due to provisioning in the accounts, CIL managed to boost its profits significantly, the company said in a release.For FY23, the firm reported a net profit of Rs 28,125 crore, up 62 percent compared to Rs 17,378 crore last year. The boost in net profit was despite provisioning Rs 8,153 crore towards wage revision of Coal India's non-executive manpower. The company said higher volume sales and increased premiums in e-auction bolstered the company’s profitability. Revenue for the year stood at Rs 1.27 lakh crore, up 27 percent YoY.Despite a 41 percent decrease in e-auction sales volume in Q4 compared to the same quarter in FY’22, Coal India was able to increase its e-auction sales revenue by Rs 690 Crores thanks to higher premiums under the e-window. The average realization per tonne of coal was Rs. 4,526 under the auction segment in Q4, which is a significant increase from Rs 2,434 in the same quarter of FY’22. The increase was Rs 2,092 per tonne, or 86 percent.Additionally, higher volume sales by 17.34 MTs and better average realization under FSA resulted in a net impact of around Rs 3,879 Crores in Q4.

"  May 08, 2023 / 01:04 PM IST  ",Analyst call tracker | IT stocks cement position in ‘Maximum Pessimism’ list after weak Q4 show; Adani shines on optimism score,"Large-cap IT companies have been languishing in analysts’ pessimism list since 2022. A year later, the picture remains unchanged.What started with two names has grown to four – Wipro, Tata Consultancy Services, Tech Mahindra and HCL Tech. The Street wasn’t expecting any fireworks from large-cap IT companies but the Q4 numbers were rather underwhelming. After the poor show, the stocks have cemented their positions further in the list.Data available with Bloomberg showed that these four IT names have higher Sell and Hold calls than Buys. Though Infosys does not feature among the top 10 names in the Maximum Pessimism list, it too has seen a fair number of downgrades after forecasting the slowest revenue growth rate in six years of 4-7 percent.Also Read: TCS, Infosys, HCL Tech record 65% decline in hiring as IT sector runs into a rough patch“Worsening outlook of top clients of IT services companies point to further pressures for Indian IT firms. This has started to reflect in the revenue growth figures of IT firms in Q4 FY23, slightly ahead of the imminent US recession,” according to analysts at Jefferies.Weakness in communications and BFSI verticals and higher scrutiny on discretionary IT spends are the key reasons keeping investors as well as mutual fund managers away from the sector.Two-wheeler firms slideApart from the IT sector, two names from the auto segment – Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto – have also made it to the ‘Maximum Pessimism’ list. Slow recovery in rural demand for two-wheelers, declining exports, particularly Nigeria nightmare for Bajaj Auto, and inconsistent trend in bottom line have kept analysts on the edge.As of April end, Hero MotoCorp had 12 Hold calls, 9 Sell calls and 26 Buy calls. Bajaj Auto had 17 Hold calls, 4 Sell calls and 27 Buy calls. Despite Hero MotoCorp beating Street estimates with Q4 results last week, no significant upgrades have trickled in for the stock. Only a turnaround in rural demand led by a good rabi harvest season, cooling of inflationary pressures in export markets and an EV strategy can change analysts’ minds.Meanwhile, in absolute terms, JSW Steel and Divi’s Laboratories remained the top two names in the Maximum Pessimism list due to high valuations, with 17 and 10 Sell calls respectively.Optimism listA short seller’s scathing report released earlier this year has had no effect on analysts’ optimism for Adani Ports. With 20 Buy calls and nil Hold or Sell calls, the stock boasts of an optimism score of 100.Also Read: CLSA has 'buy' rating on Adani Ports, raises target price to Rs 790In April, Adani Ports announced the acquisition of Karaikal Port Private Limited for Rs 1,485 crore under India’s bankruptcy law. With the takeover, its portfolio has now grown to 14 ports in India. The company has also adjusted its ambitious capital expenditure plans till FY25 to conserve cash, which is being liked by analysts.Goldman Sachs recently reaffirmed its Buy rating on Adani Ports, with a target price of Rs 810. CLSA, too, has given a Buy rating and raised the target price to Rs 790 from Rs 700. Similarly, Morgan Stanley has an Overweight stance on the company's stock and has set a target price of Rs 690.Follow our live blog for all the market actionFinancial firms stay putLike the script remains unchanged for IT stocks, so is the case for financials. Out of the 10 stocks that analysts were most optimistic about in April, 5 came from the financial space. This has been the case since November last year. State Bank of India, SBI Life Insurance Co, ICICI Bank, Housing Development Finance Corp and HDFC Bank to continue enjoy optimism scores ranging from 96 to 100.Profits of the 26 Nifty companies that have declared Q4 results so far have risen 10 percent year on year, fuelled by financials. Excluding financials, profits would have declined 1 percent year on year, according to Motilal Oswal Financial Services.Also Read: Analyst Call Tracker: Bajaj Finserv, Grasim Industries see most upgrades in April, Infosys most downgradedWith faster repricing of deposits, there was a fear of banks’ net interest margins contracting but all big private banks have managed to expand their margins in Q4 as well.
