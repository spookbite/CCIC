NIM settled at 5.7% in Q1FY24 vs 6.1% in Q4FY23 due to 30bps QoQ increase in cost of deposits to 6.6% and flattish QoQ asset yields at 13.4%. Management indicated, while bulk of deposits were already repriced at higher rates as of Jun’23, cost of funds is likely to increase by ~10bps and put pressure on NIM in Q2FY24. Asset quality deteriorated marginally, Q1 being a seasonally weak quarter for collections, with GNPL increasing by 10bps QoQ to 1.8% in Q1FY24. RoA remained steady at 1.7% and we believe likely pressure on NIM in Q2FY24 would restrict further RoA expansion in the near term.OutlookAlso, considering the sharp run-up in the stock price over past 3 months (up ~20%), we downgrade AU to HOLD (earlier: Buy) with the target price unchanged at INR 770.For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

The business though has seen good growth ever since COVID-related restrictions have begun easing, and the capex has seen a sharp drop in the last three years as the company is now pursuing an asset-light strategy.In Q1FY23, the quarter when restrictions started easing and travel was back in place ITC's hotel business rebounded. It is consistently growing after that. ITC Hotels revenue over quartersAccording to Jefferies, ITC’s hotel revenue has grown at a 12 percent CAGR from FY19 to FY23. CAGR or compounded annual growth rate is the rate at which revenue increases every year.According to Jefferies, Earnings Before Income Tax Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) has increased almost eight times in FY23 as compared to the last financial year. EBITDA has grown at a CAGR of 23 percent between FY18 and FY23. EBITDA over years for ITC Hotels, Source-JefferiesCapexITC Hotels’ investment in capex has fallen over the years.  In the last few years, ITC has adopted an 'asset-right' strategy, with a greater focus on adding properties through management contracts rather than owned hotels. Around 50 percent of rooms added in the last 3 years in the standalone entity have been through management contracts, said Jefferies. A management contract is when one company hires another company to handle all the day-to-day operations and decision-making of their business for a fee.

After the split, the consumer goods company will continue to hold a 40 percent stake in it and the rest will be distributed among existing shareholders proportionate to their stake in ITC.Though a decision to not do a full split of the newly carved hotel business came as a negative surprise for market participants, leading to a 4 percent slump in the stock on Monday, brokerages cheered for it.Global research and broking firm Morgan Stanley saw the demerger of the hotels business as a clear positive for ITC.  According to the firm, it should allay concerns over capital allocation and use of cigarettes business cashflows to develop other businesses over the medium to long term. Morgan Stanley also believes that the decision can help ITC's hotels business in charting its own growth path. The brokerage has an 'overweight' stance on ITC, with a price target of Rs 474, which includes Rs 17 for hotels.Follow our live blog for all the market actionGoldman Sachs also has a positive view for the demerger as it believes hotels was an asset-heavy business for ITC, contributing just 2 percent to its EBIT, but taking up 20 percent of the capital employed. The firm has ascribed an SOTP (sum of the parts) of Rs 12 for hotels out of its price target of Rs 470 for ITC.Adding to the list, Nomura argued the hotel demerger as a positive move for ITC because it may lead to value unlocking. It feels that the demerger will help ITC improve its balancesheet, capital allocation and RoCE (Return on Capital Employed) profile. Another positive emerging out of the spin-off as pointed out by Nomura is that it will leave ITC with surplus cash and a higher dividend payout profile as it will no longer need to provide a capex (capital expenditure) for its hotels business. The firm hailed the decision to retain control of the newly carved entity with itself.

However, the completion of the insurance buy-in of the British Steel Pension Scheme was successful, effectively reducing risks for Tata Steel UK, as stated by the company.Moreover, the company's revenue for the quarter also declined over 6 percent on year to Rs 59,490 crore, down from Rs 63,430 crore recorded in the year-ago period. The company attributed the fall in revenues to lower volumes, partly offset by higher realisations across geographies.Despite the sharp fall in numbers, Tata Steel's topline as well as bottomline still came above the Street's expectations of Rs 56,337.80 crore and Rs 122.80 crore, respectively. In that way, the better-than-expected earnings prevented a sharp slump in the steel manufacturer's stock price.Follow our live blog for all the market actionIn the first quarter, the steelmaker's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) amounted to Rs 6,122 crore.
