"  February 14, 2023 / 06:39 AM IST  ","Nykaa chief Falguni Nayar stands by bonus issue, but admits error in trading strategy","Nykaa founder and CEO Falguni Nayar said that the controversial bonus issue in the previous quarter was equal for all shareholders and aimed at creating value, but conceded that the beauty and lifestyle retail company erred in estimating the timeline of when the bonus shares could be traded.Nayar said that the company had assumed shareholders would be able to start trading the bonus shares within 4-5 days of the shareholder voting on the issue.“The bonus issue was equal for all shareholders... It can only create value and not take away value .. It was very much supported by all shareholders,” she said in a post-earnings media briefing.Nykaa’s lock-in period ended on November 10 and the record date for the bonus issue was set at November 11. Meanwhile, the voting on the bonus issue had been completed on November 2 and the allotment of new shares happened on November 12.Some investors saw this — timing the bonus issue with the ending of the lock-in period — as a ploy by the management to stop investors from selling their holdings as the lock-in period ended. They saw this as denying investors, particularly retail investors who entered at a high IPO price, a fair exit as they did not have access to the additional shares — five-sixths of their holding — for a few days.For Nykaa, the issue also stabilised the stock price that fell 8 percent on November 9, and nearly 20 percent in the preceding one month. The stock opened at Rs 171 ex-bonus on November 10, and the day on a high at Rs 185, gaining more than 5 percent in an otherwise lackluster market.The move was also seen as beneficial for early stage private equity investors of the company as it would save them taxes as they could exit the stock partially with a minimal capital gains tax.Nykaa shares ended at Rs 149.65 apiece on the BSE on February 13, down 3.26 percent.",FSN E-Commerce Ventures Ltd.
"  February 14, 2023 / 04:26 PM IST  ","Grasim Industries Q3: Profit falls 47% to Rs 257 crore, misses estimates","Grasim Industries Ltd on February 14 reported a 47 percent on-year decline in its standalone profit for the third quarter ended December 2022 (Q3FY23) at Rs 257 crore, compared to a profit of Rs 489 crore registered in the year-ago period.The number missed the street's expectations despite a favourable tax expense as the company decided to opt for a lower tax regime from the financial year 2022-23 in terms of the provision of Section 115BAA of Income-tax Act, 1961.On a sequential basis, the profit tanked 73 percent, compared to a profit of Rs 964 crore recorded during the quarter ended September 30, 2022.Standalone revenue for the Aditya Birla Group flagship rose 7 percent to Rs 6,196 crore as against a revenue of Rs 5,785 crore recorded in the year-ago period. On a sequential basis, the revenue is down 8 percent from Rs 6,745 crore it earned during the preceding quarter.“The Company reported stable financial performance over 9MFY23 despite multiple headwinds and recessionary fears globally”, the company said in its earnings release. “While domestic consumption remained healthy, global macroeconomic conditions impacted export-related demand and operational profitability for the quarter was adversely affected by elevated input prices”.The revenue growth was aided by growth in its chemicals and other businesses which witnessed a year-on-year growth of 10 percent and 18 percent, respectively. Its main business of viscose fibre and yarn; however, had a muted quarter with its revenue declining by 5 percent compared to the same period last year.The chemicals business comprises Chlor Alkali, Specialty Chemicals and Chlorine Derivatives while the others business verticals represent mainly Textiles, Insulators, Paints and B2B E-Commerce.On a sequential basis, the revenue for all three business verticals was down with the Viscose fibre and yarn business witnessing the maximum sequential decline of 18 percent, followed by the Others business vertical which was down 8 percent and the revenue for the chemicals division slid 5 percent compared to the previous quarter.Viscose Staple Fibre (VSF) value chain partners witnessed a prolonged global demand slowdown on the back of geo-political instability, recessionary fears and consequential consumption slowdown. Thus, exports-led demand from the value chain partners was impacted and ripples were felt across the Indian textiles market.The global demand slowdown and resilient demand conditions in India led to increased exports from Indonesia to India at lower prices, the company said in its earnings release. Further, zero import duty in India on these imports created pressure on domestic prices. At the same time, input prices continued to remain at elevated levels.The chemicals business returned a strong performance despite the normalisation of realisations and a slight tapering in demand on a sequential basis due to softness in sectors like textiles, pharma and others.Chlorine Integration increased to 60 percent this quarter compared to 56 percent in Q3FY22, supported by the new Chloromethane (CMS) facility commissioned in Q3FY22.At the same time, the increase in operating costs for its Viscose business was more pronounced than the other two verticals which resulted in the overall operating margins tanking by 814 basis points on-year to 8.05 percent. Compared to the September quarter, the operating margins took a hit of 638 basis points.The power and fuel cost during the quarter surged 180 basis points on-year and 202 basis points QoQ while the other expenses jumped 268 basis points YoY and 262 basis points compared to the previous quarter. This increase severely impacted the performance and margins for the quarter.Update on Paints and B2B E-Commerce businessAs per the company release, the construction progress remains on track across all six plant locations. The state-of-the-art R&D facility has been commissioned. It is now working on developing innovative products for unique customer experiences. The commercial launch is scheduled for Q4FY24, as per plan.In the B2B E-commerce business, most of the senior leadership team has joined and hiring for the next level is in process. Shortlisting of partners (sourcing, logistics, vendors, etc.) is near completion and while the pilot operations have started from January 2023 the full-scale launch will commence from H1FY24.Capex PlansThe company in its release provided an update on its capex plans and updated that the total capex spent towards Paints Business till December 31, 2022, stood at Rs 1,817 crore. (~18 percent of the total planned outlay for the Paints business).The total Capex for all other businesses was Rs 1,370 core in the first nine months of the current fiscal as against a budget of Rs 3,498 crore for FY23.

Grasim is scheduled to declare its results for the quarter ended December 2022 on Tuesday, February 14.Experts expect the standalone revenues of the company, comprising viscose (fibre and yarn) and chemicals (caustic soda and allied chemicals) to grow 13 percent on-year, but the revenues are likely to remain flat with a marginal dip of 3 percent compared to the previous quarter.According to a poll of brokerages conducted by Moneycontrol, the flagship company of the Aditya Birla Group is forecasted to report a standalone PAT of Rs 379 crore for the quarter, and the standalone revenues are likely to come in at Rs 6,545 crore.The company had recorded a standalone PAT of Rs 489 crore during the corresponding period of the previous year when it had achieved revenues of Rs 5,785 crore.During the September ending quarter, the standalone PAT stood at Rs 964 crore on revenues of Rs 6,745 crore.The YoY growth in revenues is likely to be aided by favourable market conditions for both the viscose and chemicals businesses, which are likely to see a low to mid-single digit growth in both, volumes and realisations.However, the increase in input costs will negate the growth in revenues and might result in a margin contraction of 4 percent on-year and 2 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) to 12 percent.Brokerage and research firm, Kotak Institutional Equities, models a “7.1 percent YoY volume increase in VSF operations and a 6.1 percent YoY volume increase in the chemical operations led by ramp-up of new capacity partly offset by near-term demand headwinds”.At the same time, the analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd (MOFSL) expect revenue for the VSF business to grow by 8 percent on-year, while that of the chemicals segment to grow by 6 percent YoY, led by 1 percent YoY growth in volume in both the businesses, and 7 percent YoY growth in VSF realisations, while realisation in chemicals is likely to witness an uptick of 5 percent YoY.The increase in operating costs is likely to cause serious damage to the earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of both the businesses, with the VSF business seeing an on-year decline of close to 45 percent in its EBITDA, while the chemicals business is likely to see a mid-single digit decline.The experts at MOFSL expect EBITDA per kg of Rs 11.9 for the VSF segment (including VFY), compared to Rs 23.6 per kg during the same period a year ago, and Rs 17.8 per kg in the previous quarter of the current fiscal.They expect EBITDA for the company to decline by 25 percent on-year led by a sharp decline of 49 percent YoY in EBITDA and operating margin contraction of 6.4 percent in the VSF business. EBITDA in the chemicals segment is expected to decline 6 percent YoY, while its operating margin is expected to decline 2.6 percent YoY, and 2.5 percent QoQ to 20 percent.Kotak Institutional Equities estimates, “VSF EBITDA of Rs 130 crore (-67 percent YoY, -60 percent QoQ) on weaker realisations, and chemicals EBITDA of Rs 580 crore (+10.2 percent YoY, -4.4 percent QoQ), benefiting from elevated prices”.Grasim closed Rs 13 lower at Rs 1,622.3 on February 13 at the National Stock Exchange.

It attributed the low revenue growth to poor consumer sentiment and ARS implementation, which hurt its primary sales. The EBITDA margin was hit by lower absorption of factory overheads, normalised media spends and high-cost stocks. Ahead, demand per management is still affected. Margins should improve now as its high-cost stocks are almost exhausted. In the past it maintained margins of 20-21% and will now control costs to ensure this continues. To bake in the slower demand, we reduce our FY23e-FY25e sales 2-3%.OutlookOur FY23e/FY24e/FY25e EPS are ~15%/14%/12% lower as we expect a slightly lower EBITDA margin. Key monitorables are growth and margins. Core-innerwear growth pace being maintained is a key positive. On the steep stock-price drop, we upgrade our rating to a Buy, with a TP of Rs45,938 (55x FY25e EPS of Rs835).For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.
