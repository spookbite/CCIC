JSW Group aims to raise up to $500 million from this stake sale, which will likely be utilised for expanding its presence in the renewable energy space.JSW Neo Energy is likely to serve as the entity through which JSW Group consolidates its upcoming green power projects.JSW Energy intends to transfer its existing hydro energy projects into subsidiaries under JSW Neo Energy as part of a strategic move to streamline its renewables portfolio, establish an efficient fundraising structure, and unlock value for shareholders, according to the report.Later, in a clarification issued to the exchanges, JSW Energy said that in linewith its stated strategy of growing in the renewable energy sector, ""the company has been evaluating various opportunities.""""Please note that currently, the company is not aware of any such information or event which is significant and/or price sensitive, which theCompany may need to disseminate to investors for their information,"" the regulatory filing added.TPG, a US private equity firm with existing investments in India, including BookMyShow and Dream11, previously invested $1 billion into Tata Motors through its Rise Climate fund.
