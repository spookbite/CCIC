"  February 11, 2023 / 07:27 PM IST  ",Buy Hero Motocorp; target of Rs 2959: HDFC Securities,"HDFC Securities' research report on Hero MotocorpHero MotoCorp’s (HMC) Q3 PAT, at INR 7.1bn, was in line with our estimate of INR 7bn. EBITDA margin remained stable QoQ, on expected lines, as benefits from softening input costs were offset by weak volumes in Q2 (down 13% QoQ). Management is hopeful of a rural revival in the coming quarters on the back of the positive rural sentiment and hence expects the 2W industry to post double-digit revenue growth in FY24. HMC would target to outperform industry growth and recover back lost market share, especially in the 125cc and above motorcycle segment as also in scooters, on the back of a healthy launch pipeline—it aims to launch one new model each quarter from here on. Its recent launch, Xoom, in the 110cc segment, comes loaded with many segment-first features and is in line with the same strategy highlighted above.OutlookHowever, given a lower-than-expected demand in Q3 and sustained weakness in Q4, we lower our earnings estimates by 1-6% over FY23-25E. At 14.7x FY24 PER, the valuation is attractive.

Hero Motocorp’s (HMCL) 3Q EBITDA margin at 11.5% (-67bps YoY, +7bps QoQ) came slightly lower than our estimates at 11.8%, due to 70bps impact from Vida launch and higher discounting. We expect 2W industry to benefit from rural recovery, low base of export markets and stable pricing environment (as commodity prices cool down in FY24). Accordingly, HMCL is also expected to show double-digit revenue growth in FY24 given (1) product launches in premium/scooter segment, (2) improving market share and (3) higher exports. We expect HMCL’s margins to improve in the near term from operating leverage, premiumisation (3QFY23: 30% of volumes vs 20% during last festive season), cost control and stable commodity costs (we build in 230bps expansion over FY22-25E).OutlookThe company is investing in EVs and aims to have wider product portfolio in next 18-24 months.
