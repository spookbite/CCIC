"  March 16, 2023 / 10:42 AM IST  ","OMCs gain, ONGC, Oil India crack as crude falls below $75","BPCL, HPCL and Indian Oil shares were trading up to 4 percent higher in the early trade on March 16 after Brent crude fell below the $75 per barrel mark for the first time since 2021.At 9.30 am, Bharat Petroleum was quoting at Rs 342.70, up 3.7 percent from the previous close. HPCL gained 4 percent to trade at Rs 240 and Indian Oil was higher by 1.65 percent at Rs 79.80.Follow our live blog for all the market actionOil marketing companies' (OMCs) profitability was hit in 2022 when they had to hold pump prices despite rising crude.OMCs typically revise retail petrol and diesel prices daily based on the rolling average of international benchmark prices over the past 15 days. However, they left prices unchanged in 2022 despite soaring crude prices to control inflation in the country, which dented their bottom line.""As international oil prices cool, marketing losses will ease for the three state-owned refining and marketing companies, IOC, BPCL and HPCL,” ratings agency Moody’s said.Shares of upstream companies like ONGC and Oil India took a beating. ONGC shares were down 2.5 percent at Rs 148.50 on the NSE, while Oil India was down 3 percent at Rs 250, around 9:45 am.Every $1 a barrel rise in crude realisation implies a 2-4 percent increase in earnings per share for these two companies, according to analysts’ calculations. So a fall in crude prices is bad news for them.Oil India has a dividend yield of 5.5 percent and its shares are up 17 percent for the year so far. Meanwhile, ONGC, which has a dividend yield of 6.7 percent, has given flat returns in 2023 till date.",Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd.

Patanjali Ayurved is among the 21 promoter and promoter group entities against whom the action has been taken.Also Read | Sebi action against promoters group will not affect business, says PatanjaliAs per the rules mandated by the Security and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), at least a 25 percent stake in a listed entity must be held by public shareholders. The stake held by public shareholders in Patanjali Foods stood at 19.18 percent as of December-end.The company, earlier known as Ruchi Soya, had undergone an insolvency resolution process which was initiated by the National Company Law Tribunal in 2017. The resolution plan, as submitted by Patanjali Ayurved, received the tribunal's nod in 2019.After the resolution plan was implemented, Patanjali Foods' public shareholding contracted to 1.10 percent. As per the regulatory norms, a company that undergoes insolvency process gets a period of three years to increase its minimum shareholding to 25 percent.To comply with the norm, Patanjali Foods had launched a follow-on public offer (FPO) in March 2022. It succeeded in increasing the public shareholding to 19.18 percent by issuing a total of 66.2 million shares.However, the company could not increase its public shareholding since then. A failure to meet the SEBI's three-year deadline to increase the stake to 25 percent has led to the freezing of promoter shares.Patanjali Foods' shares settled at Rs 964.40 at the NSE, which was 1.3 percent higher as against the previous day's close.The company, in the quarter ended December 2022, had posted a net profit of Rs 269 crore, which was 15 percent higher than the year-ago period.
