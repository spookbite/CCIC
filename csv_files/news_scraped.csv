"  April 21, 2023 / 07:30 PM IST  ","HDFC Bank merger: RBI’s regulatory leeway positive for stock, say analysts","The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has allowed some regulatory relief to HDFC Bank Ltd ahead of its merger with HDFC, which is a positive for the stock, analysts said.In a regulatory filing on April 21, HDFC Bank said the RBI has allowed calculating the Adjusted Net Bank Credit (for PSL) considering only one-third of the outstanding loans of HDFC as on the effective date of the amalgamation for the first year.The remaining two-thirds shall be considered over the next two years equally.Also Read: RBI allows HDFC Bank to hike stake in HDFC Life, HDFC ERGO to more than 50%“Assuming PSL requirements would kick in only in FY25, PSL cost would reduce from Rs 20 bn to Rs 5 bn implying a core PAT upgrade of 2 percent,” brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher said in a note.Domestic banks are required to lend 40 percent of their total disbursal to the priority sector, which includes agriculture, MSMEs, education, housing, export credit and advances to weaker sections.“The HDFC Ltd portfolio will be allowed three years (in equal instalments), after the first year post merger, to become PSL compliant. This is against the earlier assumption of 18 months from effective date to be PSL compliant,” Dhananjay Sinha of Systematix Group told Moneycontrol.Also read: HDFC to complete its merger with HDFC Bank by JulyInvestments including subsidiaries and associates of HDFC Limited have been allowed to continue as investments of HDFC Bank.The RBI has also allowed HDFC Bank or HDFC Limited to increase the shareholding in HDFC Life and HDFC ERGO to more than 50 percent.“This certainly removes the overhang of RoE dilution due to stake sale. Also this would be a positive for HDFC Life,” the brokerage said.Assuming the stake would increase to 51 percent, sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) impact would be Rs 3-4 on HDFC Bank’s target price of Rs 1,925, it noted.The stock should see a positive reaction, it added.“The RBI rule had originally mandated that the shareholding in the insurance subsidiary can be either above 50 percent or at 30 percent. With the current HDFC Ltd shareholding in HDFC Life at 48.65 percent, there was the overhang on HDFC Life shares of the possibility of selling from HDFC Ltd to become compliant with the extant regulations,” Sinha said, adding this removes a major overhang on HDFC Life shares.No relaxation has been granted on CRR, SLR and LCR norms, which was the consensus view and HDFC Bank has also utilised the time from announcement of merger to plan for this eventuality, he added.In a recent note, Prabhudas Lilladher assigned a buy rating on HDFC Bank with target price of Rs 1,925. Based on April 21’s closing price of Rs 1,673.80, this implies a potential upside of nearly 15 percent.Termed as the biggest transaction in India’s corporate history, HDFC Bank on April 4 last year agreed to take over the biggest housing finance company in a deal valued at about $40 billion, creating a financial services titan. The proposed entity will have a combined asset base of around Rs 18 lakh crore.The deal has got in-principle approval from the stock exchanges, Reserve Bank of India (RBI), SEBI, Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), and Competition Commission of India (CCI).",HDFC Bank Ltd.

Recent reports indicate that the Dalmia Bharat Group plans to sell off its entire 15 percent stake in India's primary power trading platform.In its previous report, Bernstein expressed concerns about multiple challenges that IEX may face in the future. First, the entry of a strong competitor, PTC India, and ensuing price wars. Second, the risk of tariff ceiling, and third, the possibility of mandatory coupling if market-based economic despatch (MBED) is implemented.This would result in the mandatory pooling of power and exchanges. The report also noted that the volumes on the exchange had fallen in the current quarter due to a lower ceiling for transactions. In addition, Bernstein expressed skepticism about the exponential growth potential of IEX and believed that the stock was overpriced.The brokerage firm has upgraded Biocon to an ‘outperform’ rating based on positive developments in the US biosimilar market. Reliance Industries was reintroduced, while M&M has corrected due to concerns over the slowdown in rural markets caused by weaker-than-expected monsoon. The brokerage firm retained Infosys, Zomato, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, State Bank of India, Cipla, Crompton Consumer, Ultratech and L&T to its portfolio.It reports that a reduction in commodities is expected to support margins, and early-cycle benefits in financials and real estate are increasing the expectation of low earnings risk. The firm argues for positive returns in the near term, with Nifty heading back to 18,000-18,500.The brokerage firm reports that while some sectors have seen downward revisions, upgrades in financials have offset these declines. A reduction in commodities is expected to support margins, and early-cycle benefits in financials and real estate are increasing the expectation of low earnings risk.""Since we see this as more driven by the domestic economy, we highlighted sectors like financials, real estate, and cement to do well. The early cycle nature of recovery is expected to support these sectors, and we still maintain our ‘OW’ stance. We also remain a marginal OW’ on IT, healthcare, and durables. We remain ‘UW’ on staples, utilities, metals and industrials (excluding L&T, cement),"" Bernstein said in its report.The brokerage firm sees the Q3 GDP growth of 4.4 percent as the bottom, with interest rates and inflation nearing their peak and margin risks moderating due to a decline in commodities. Positive support from early cycle sectors like real estate and financials, along with a good winter cropping season, are expected to boost growth. Manufacturing growth is expected to turn positive in Q4FY23 after YoY declines in Q2/Q3FY23.

The Reserve Bank of India also has recently paused key interest rates for now but hinted at possible increases going forward in its battle to further weaken inflation without damaging economic growth. The US Federal Reserve, whereas, still combats the persistently high US inflation challenge with one more rate hike anticipated in the next FOMC meeting.

Pre Provision Operating Profit (PPOP) is likely to rise by 36.5 percent Y-o-Y (up 5.8 percent Q-o-Q) to Rs 14,047.4 crore.Whereas, Kotak Institutional Equities anticipates the pre-provision profit to grow by around 33 percent YoY. “We expect a PPOP to grow at ~33 percent YoY as we expect most operating metrics to be stable to positive. Loan growth to be solid at around 20 percent YoY driven by healthy contribution from all segments. The rate cycle is still favorable but scope for NIM expansion is coming to an end. We are building flat NIM QoQ at 4.7 percent. Key concern would be the reversal of NIM as cost of funds is starting to move up sharply for the sector, especially with slower CASA growth.”ICICI Bank most recent business updateICICI Bank's board will also meet on April 22 to consider and approve fundraising by way of issuance of debt securities, including NCDs, bonds and other instruments on a private placement basis.

"  April 21, 2023 / 01:06 PM IST  ","Bernstein Research removes IEX short, adds RIL, Biocon, M&M to portfolio","Bernstein Research has removed Indian Energy Exchange Ltd short position and eliminated its 10 percent allocation to cash from its portfolio as it expects a market rebound in the second quarter of 2023, while adding Reliance Industries, Biocon, and Mahindra and Mahindra to its portfolio.Over the past year, IEX's stock has been declining steadily, with the shares falling by almost 35 percent. Recent reports indicate that the Dalmia Bharat Group plans to sell off its entire 15 percent stake in India's primary power trading platform.In its previous report, Bernstein expressed concerns about multiple challenges that IEX may face in the future. First, the entry of a strong competitor, PTC India, and ensuing price wars. Second, the risk of tariff ceiling, and third, the possibility of mandatory coupling if market-based economic despatch (MBED) is implemented.This would result in the mandatory pooling of power and exchanges. The report also noted that the volumes on the exchange had fallen in the current quarter due to a lower ceiling for transactions. In addition, Bernstein expressed skepticism about the exponential growth potential of IEX and believed that the stock was overpriced.The brokerage firm has upgraded Biocon to an ‘outperform’ rating based on positive developments in the US biosimilar market. Reliance Industries was reintroduced, while M&M has corrected due to concerns over the slowdown in rural markets caused by weaker-than-expected monsoon. The brokerage firm retained Infosys, Zomato, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, State Bank of India, Cipla, Crompton Consumer, Ultratech and L&T to its portfolio.It reports that a reduction in commodities is expected to support margins, and early-cycle benefits in financials and real estate are increasing the expectation of low earnings risk. The firm argues for positive returns in the near term, with Nifty heading back to 18,000-18,500.The brokerage firm reports that while some sectors have seen downward revisions, upgrades in financials have offset these declines. A reduction in commodities is expected to support margins, and early-cycle benefits in financials and real estate are increasing the expectation of low earnings risk.""Since we see this as more driven by the domestic economy, we highlighted sectors like financials, real estate, and cement to do well. The early cycle nature of recovery is expected to support these sectors, and we still maintain our ‘OW’ stance. We also remain a marginal OW’ on IT, healthcare, and durables. We remain ‘UW’ on staples, utilities, metals and industrials (excluding L&T, cement),"" Bernstein said in its report.The brokerage firm sees the Q3 GDP growth of 4.4 percent as the bottom, with interest rates and inflation nearing their peak and margin risks moderating due to a decline in commodities. Positive support from early cycle sectors like real estate and financials, along with a good winter cropping season, are expected to boost growth. Manufacturing growth is expected to turn positive in Q4FY23 after YoY declines in Q2/Q3FY23. Although the outlook for monsoons is unclear, recent comments from IMD suggest a normal monsoon season.",Infosys Ltd.
"  April 23, 2023 / 02:36 PM IST  ","Reliance Industries monitoring OPEC+ supply cut impact on price, demand: CFO","The recent oil production cut announced by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, known as OPEC+, might impact demand if prices remain high, V Srikanth, Chief Financial Officer, Reliance Industries Ltd said on April 21 after the conglomerate announced its financial results.On April 3, OPEC+, announced a surprise supply cut of around 1.16 million barrels per day (bpd), in addition to the earlier cuts, from May till the end of 2023. In October 2022, OPEC had agreed to cut production by 2 million bpd.Crude oil prices have been on an upward trajectory since the OPEC announcement. US benchmark Brent crude, which had slumped to $72 per barrel, is now trading around $85 per barrel.“The challenges that we have to look out for is that if there are oil production cuts and prices go up whether it has an impact on demand. One would also look out for any increase in product exports from China,” Srikanth said.He said that the company will also monitor potential economic contraction in EU and US as it may impact India’s downstream exports.Reliance Industries on April 21 reported 19.1 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in consolidated profit at Rs 19,299 crore for the quarter ended March of the financial year 2022-23. Gross revenue from operations of India's most valued company came in at Rs 2.39 lakh crore, registering a year-on-year rise of 2.8 percent.Gas outlookIndian gas market outlook remains positive due to lower global prices and higher domestic gas availability, said Srikanth.Lower global prices make gas more competitive and give more choices to buyers, he said.RIL operating income from its oil and gas business was at an 8-year high with steady KG D6 production at around 19 mmscmd and higher energy prices. Gas production at KG D6 is likely to increase to 30 mmscmd in FY24 with commissioning of the MJ field, RIL added.",Reliance Industries Ltd.
