The underlying volumes for Q4FY23 were lower by 12.0% YoY/ 12.6% QoQ. ASP increased by 27.3% YoY/ 9.5% QoQ. Despite the YoY drop in volumes, revenue growth was supported by favourable FX realization, judicious price hikes, and a better product mix. Consolidated EBITDA was INR 16,572 mn (+21.8% YoY/ -5.7% QoQ). EBITDA margin improved by 150 bps YoY but declined by 30 bps QoQ to 18.6%. Bajaj Auto has started reporting Share of associates only on a half-yearly basis, leading to non-comparability of Net Profit on a QoQ and YoY basis. Reported PAT for Q4FY23 was INR 17,047 mn (+11.7% YoY/ +15.8% QoQ). Adjusting for exceptional items, Adj. PAT growth was 40.8% YoY/ 15.8% QoQ, which is still influenced by the difference in reporting of share of associates. For FY23, Adj. PAT was INR 60,602 mn, which is a growth of 13.3% YoY.OutlookWe assign a P/E multiple of 17.0x on FY25E EPS of INR 279.8 to arrive at a target price of INR 4,756/share (INR 4,564/share previously); implying an upside potential of 8.2% from the CMP.

The FMCG business clocked an annual turnover of Rs 622 crore in FY23, so the valuation works out to 5.4x sales.""The deal is not expensive. Raymond Consumer Care has Rs 100 crore cash and there's a tax break of Rs 400 crore. So, the net cost of acquisition works out to about Rs 2300 crore - that's 3.75x FY23 sales,"" GCPL Chief Executive Officer Sudhir Sitapati explained in a press briefing.Also Read: Godrej Consumer to acquire Raymond’s consumer care business for Rs 2,825 croreGodrej Consumer is yet to announce how the acquisition will be funded. It roughly has Rs 2,000 crore of cash on books. ""We will figure it out in the next few days,"" said Sitapati.The company will not only be acquiring Raymond's FMCG business but also the trademarks of Park Avenue (for the FMCG category), KS, KamaSutra and Premium, through a slump sale.Moneycontrol had earlier today reported that Godrej Consumer Products is likely to announce the acquisition of Raymond's consumer care business.Meanwhile, Raymond will retain its condom manufacturing facility and will continue to do contract manufacturing in Aurangabad for both domestic and international markets. It will supply condoms to GCPL.""Raymond's FMCG brands currently have single-digit operating (EBITDA) margin. But on a gross margin level, they are similar to us. I am confident that we can bring the EBITDA margins also to our level soon,"" said Sitapati.Godrej Consumer's EBITDA margins have ranged between 20-22 percent over the past three years.Explaining the rationale behind the acquisition, Sitapati said that GCPL's main focus has always been India, where it has a high salience to soaps. “Soaps is a slow-growing category in India. Meanwhile, sexual wellness and deodorant categories are rapidly growing,"" he explained.If the Kama Sutra and Park Avenue brands manage to grow at 10 percent rate, it will be a good acquisition for us, he added.Despite the name clash with the apparel brand Park Avenue, which remains housed under Raymond, Godrej Consumer Products has no plans of renaming the Park Avenue line of shampoos and deodorants, as of now.""The brand is well conceived. It will be a symbiotic relationship,"" said Sitapati.When it comes to synergies, Godrej Consumer Products' direct distribution is 4x that of Raymond Consumer Care's. So, Raymond's products will reach farther and wider. While both companies reach the same number of chemists across the country, the overlap is less, so both stand to benefit, he said.On April 27, the stock closed at Rs 954.80 on the NSE, lower by 2.19 percent from previous close.

"  April 28, 2023 / 11:07 AM IST  ",Life insurance stocks record renewed interest as investors shrug off growth concerns,"On February 1, listed life insurers saw their valuations erode by more than 10 percent as the Union Budget brought in tax rules that would shave off a big part of their business growth. Investors believed that the stellar growth trajectory of the industry was now a thing of the past and so valuations should come down.Since April, though, life insurance shares have gained, in a sign that the earlier expectations of growth deceleration were overdone. Shares of the largest life insurer, Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), have risen nearly 1 percent. ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company Ltd's stock has gained nearly 2 percent, while Max Financial Services Ltd has gained roughly 1 percent. HDFC Life Insurance Company Ltd and SBI Life Insurance Company Ltd have gained more than 3 percent.So, what has changed for investors to be nibbling on life insurance stocks now? The answer: another change in tax rules and a returning optimism on growth.Tax lost is tax gainedIn the budget, the government had proposed that the proceeds of insurance policies with premiums in excess of Rs 5 lakh would be taxed in the hands of the holder. Further, the centre made the new tax regime, which removes almost all exemptions, as the default tax regime from 2023-24 onwards. To be sure, shifting to the new tax regime remains optional, but the government’s intent cannot be ignored.These rules, which took effect on April 1, were seen as hurting business growth for the life insurance companies. After all, India’s life insurers relied on deep-pocketed clients who invested lumpy amounts to avail of tax exemptions.But on April 1, another tax rule change took effect. The government removed the indexation benefit on debt mutual funds by bringing all of them under the marginal tax rate. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities believe that some of the investment into these debt funds could now reflow into insurance policies with a smaller premium size.“Notably, income from non-linked insurance policies below Rs 0.5 million of the annual premium remain(s) tax-free; hence, we believe that some incremental flows from debt mutual funds may be directed to such policies. This will help offset the impact of the slowdown in high ticket (over Rs 0.5 million) policies,” they wrote in the April 21 note.Further, there are mitigating tactics that can help insurers bypass the tax exemption rule. “The Rs 500k annual premium limit for tax breaks on traditional (par/non-par) products is seen as relevant to a small section of potential demand, given mitigations are possible (for example, splitting the premium between spouses in the same family),” wrote Santanu Chakrabarti, an analyst at BNP Paribas India in a note.A stronger MarchListed life insurers lived up to the expectations of investors in the January-March quarter. SBI Life reported 11 percent growth in total annualised premium equivalent and profitability metrics, such as value of the new business. And its margins beat Street expectations. HDFC Life, too, reported healthy growth metrics but the acquisition of Exide Life resulted in an increase in expense ratios.That said, analysts believe that repeating growth in FY24 won’t be an easy task for life insurers.The outsized business growth in the March quarter was expected as life insurers made last-ditch efforts to sell as many large-sized policies as possible before the tax changes took effect. The 59 percent surge in the ticket size of policies for the month of March shows this last-minute dash. For HDFC Life, this rush contributed to 35 percent of premiums in March.Even so, listed life insurers exceeded market expectations of business growth for the quarter. Analysts at Morgan Stanley pointed out that the 38 percent year-on-year growth in retail weighted received premium (RWRP) for the industry and 56 percent for private life insurers were much stronger than expectations. Data from the industry regulator showed that private sector life insurers reported 53 percent business growth for March, taking the overall growth for FY23 to 24 percent, on an annualised premium equivalent basis.Further, management guidance on growth in FY24 has been optimistic amid emerging concerns over the tax rule impact. Chief executives of life insurers have asserted that tax exemptions are no longer the driving factor for life insurance policies.All this is contributing to the interest among investors in life insurance stocks.Future imperfectThe growth in FY23 may have exceeded expectations but the outlook for FY24 is still cloudy. This explains why the gains in life insurance stocks have so far been modest. Further, investors are awaiting the fourth-quarter earnings of insurers such as SBI Life, LIC and HDFC Life in the coming weeks. The results of ICICI Prulife, which released its Q4 earnings on April 20, show that investors’ assumptions on profitability and growth have been met.Meanwhile, the impact of the tax rule changes on life insurers will be fully visible only in the second half of FY24. Insurers are already putting in place mitigating measures through changes in pricing and the product mix. How much they will be able to reverse the impact on growth will be keenly monitored.Chakrabarti of BNP Paribas pointed out that current valuations reflect the concerns surrounding growth. “We continue to believe that current market prices reflect the fear of both a near-term revenue decline as well as a reduction in TAM (total addressable market),” he said.Most analysts expect insurance stocks to be under pressure in FY24 given the growth concerns. At the same time, valuations look appealing for some after the sharp post-budget erosion. Re-rating triggers, though, are slim and should be visible two quarters down.",HDFC Life Insurance Company Ltd.

"  April 28, 2023 / 11:07 AM IST  ",Life insurance stocks record renewed interest as investors shrug off growth concerns,"On February 1, listed life insurers saw their valuations erode by more than 10 percent as the Union Budget brought in tax rules that would shave off a big part of their business growth. Investors believed that the stellar growth trajectory of the industry was now a thing of the past and so valuations should come down.Since April, though, life insurance shares have gained, in a sign that the earlier expectations of growth deceleration were overdone. Shares of the largest life insurer, Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), have risen nearly 1 percent. ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company Ltd's stock has gained nearly 2 percent, while Max Financial Services Ltd has gained roughly 1 percent. HDFC Life Insurance Company Ltd and SBI Life Insurance Company Ltd have gained more than 3 percent.So, what has changed for investors to be nibbling on life insurance stocks now? The answer: another change in tax rules and a returning optimism on growth.Tax lost is tax gainedIn the budget, the government had proposed that the proceeds of insurance policies with premiums in excess of Rs 5 lakh would be taxed in the hands of the holder. Further, the centre made the new tax regime, which removes almost all exemptions, as the default tax regime from 2023-24 onwards. To be sure, shifting to the new tax regime remains optional, but the government’s intent cannot be ignored.These rules, which took effect on April 1, were seen as hurting business growth for the life insurance companies. After all, India’s life insurers relied on deep-pocketed clients who invested lumpy amounts to avail of tax exemptions.But on April 1, another tax rule change took effect. The government removed the indexation benefit on debt mutual funds by bringing all of them under the marginal tax rate. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities believe that some of the investment into these debt funds could now reflow into insurance policies with a smaller premium size.“Notably, income from non-linked insurance policies below Rs 0.5 million of the annual premium remain(s) tax-free; hence, we believe that some incremental flows from debt mutual funds may be directed to such policies. This will help offset the impact of the slowdown in high ticket (over Rs 0.5 million) policies,” they wrote in the April 21 note.Further, there are mitigating tactics that can help insurers bypass the tax exemption rule. “The Rs 500k annual premium limit for tax breaks on traditional (par/non-par) products is seen as relevant to a small section of potential demand, given mitigations are possible (for example, splitting the premium between spouses in the same family),” wrote Santanu Chakrabarti, an analyst at BNP Paribas India in a note.A stronger MarchListed life insurers lived up to the expectations of investors in the January-March quarter. SBI Life reported 11 percent growth in total annualised premium equivalent and profitability metrics, such as value of the new business. And its margins beat Street expectations. HDFC Life, too, reported healthy growth metrics but the acquisition of Exide Life resulted in an increase in expense ratios.That said, analysts believe that repeating growth in FY24 won’t be an easy task for life insurers.The outsized business growth in the March quarter was expected as life insurers made last-ditch efforts to sell as many large-sized policies as possible before the tax changes took effect. The 59 percent surge in the ticket size of policies for the month of March shows this last-minute dash. For HDFC Life, this rush contributed to 35 percent of premiums in March.Even so, listed life insurers exceeded market expectations of business growth for the quarter. Analysts at Morgan Stanley pointed out that the 38 percent year-on-year growth in retail weighted received premium (RWRP) for the industry and 56 percent for private life insurers were much stronger than expectations. Data from the industry regulator showed that private sector life insurers reported 53 percent business growth for March, taking the overall growth for FY23 to 24 percent, on an annualised premium equivalent basis.Further, management guidance on growth in FY24 has been optimistic amid emerging concerns over the tax rule impact. Chief executives of life insurers have asserted that tax exemptions are no longer the driving factor for life insurance policies.All this is contributing to the interest among investors in life insurance stocks.Future imperfectThe growth in FY23 may have exceeded expectations but the outlook for FY24 is still cloudy. This explains why the gains in life insurance stocks have so far been modest. Further, investors are awaiting the fourth-quarter earnings of insurers such as SBI Life, LIC and HDFC Life in the coming weeks. The results of ICICI Prulife, which released its Q4 earnings on April 20, show that investors’ assumptions on profitability and growth have been met.Meanwhile, the impact of the tax rule changes on life insurers will be fully visible only in the second half of FY24. Insurers are already putting in place mitigating measures through changes in pricing and the product mix. How much they will be able to reverse the impact on growth will be keenly monitored.Chakrabarti of BNP Paribas pointed out that current valuations reflect the concerns surrounding growth. “We continue to believe that current market prices reflect the fear of both a near-term revenue decline as well as a reduction in TAM (total addressable market),” he said.Most analysts expect insurance stocks to be under pressure in FY24 given the growth concerns. At the same time, valuations look appealing for some after the sharp post-budget erosion. Re-rating triggers, though, are slim and should be visible two quarters down.",SBI Life Insurance Company Ltd.

We see strong momentum for RAC continuing upcoming summer and steady improvement in project business.For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

"  April 28, 2023 / 03:26 PM IST  ",Hold Voltas; target of Rs 848: Prabhudas Lilladher,"Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on VoltasVoltas (VOLT) is continuously losing its market share in RAC (Feb-23 YTD market share at 21.9% v/s 22.8%/22.5% in Sep/Dec’22 and 18.2% in Feb-23) and we believe in coming year competition will increase as players like Blue Star, Lloyd, Daikin and LG India are soon expected to come up with their own manufacturing facilities. Management expects good volume growth in upcoming summer season, but not taking price hikes (because of competition) will impact margins. Besides that - challenges related to RAC market share, lower margins in project business and reported losses in Beko JV will also continue. Yet better traction in order flow from domestic project business and healthy order book of Rs 81.5bn provides visibility for EMPS segment. Moreover, VOLT’s FY23 share price declined ~35% YTD, however, has limited downside risk, in our view. Downgrade to ‘HOLD’.OutlookWe downward revise our FY24/25E adjusted earnings by 12.0%/6.5% to factor in 1) gross margin contraction given price competition in RAC business and 2) margin contraction in EMPS business, due to delay in collections & increase in domestic project business. Accordingly, we reduce UCP segment’s target multiple to 42x from 45x FY25EPS, given concerns on market share sustainability and downgrade to ‘HOLD’ (earlier ‘BUY’) at SOTP based revised TP of Rs848 (earlier Rs970).For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

IT Services Segment Revenue increased to USD 2,823.0 million, an increase of 0.7% QoQ and 3.7% YoY; while Non-GAAP constant currency IT Services segment revenue decreased 0.6% sequentially and increased 6.5% on a YoY basis with offshore revenue comprising 59.7% of the revenue mix. Quarterly revenue growth was led by improvement in cloud infrastructure and Digital operations. IT Services Operating Margin for the quarter was at 16.3%, recording a flat sequential growth. Net Income for the quarter was at INR 30.7 billion (USD 374.1 million), an increase of 0.7% QoQ and a decrease of 0.4% on a YoY basis.

"  April 28, 2023 / 05:58 PM IST  ",Neutral Wipro; target of Rs 360: Motilal Oswal,"Motilal Oswal's research report on WiproWipro (WPRO) posted a 0.6% QoQ CC decline in 4QFY23 IT Services revenue due to weak macro and cuts in discretionary spends despite a strong order intake over the last few quarters. Its 1QFY24 revenue guidance of -3% to -1% CC reflects further hit from cuts in discretionary spends and consulting practice. The company’s 4QFY23 EBIT margin in IT Services was flat QoQ to 16.3% and in line with our estimates. Amid macro uncertainties, management guided for flat margins in 1QFY24. WPRO’s weak 1QFY24 revenue guidance and soft near-term outlook were negatives given the continued strength in deal momentum over the last few quarters. Management indicated that slower decision making and cuts in discretionary spends should continue to impact 1QFY24 adversely.OutlookWe cut our FY24E/FY25E EPS by 7.2%/4.4% to factor in weaker FY24E growth due to a lower exit rate in 4QFY23 and muted 1HFY24. Reiterate Neutral as we view the current valuation as fair. Our TP of INR360 implies 14x FY25E EPS.For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.
