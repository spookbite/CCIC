"  July 10, 2023 / 12:28 PM IST  ","F&O Manual: Nifty faces stiff resistance at 19,500, shows volatile moves","The market shows sideways momentum amid some cautiousness which seeped in ahead of the earnings season that starts this week.On Monday, July 10, the indices traded with volatility, edging towards the green zone backed by strong support from Reliance Industries (RIL) shares, according to analysts. As of 10:45 am, the Nifty traded 92 points or 0.48 percent up at 19,424.40, while the Bank Nifty also traded 100.55 points or 0.22 percent up at 45,025.55. Red bars show call option OI and green put option OI.Amid volatility, option data shows sideways momentum, with 19,400 levels becoming a battleground in Nifty where both call and put writers are in a tussle. The key support level was seen at 19,300, while the first resistance was at 19,500 levels. The range of 19,500-19,600 appears to be an immediate hurdle for the anticipated consolidation, while the major breakout levels around 19,000-18,900 serve as a strong foundation for the market.Rahul K Ghose, Founder and CEO of Hedged, an algorithm-powered advisory platform, believes that the 19,000 puts still have very heavy put writing and will act as support for the Index. ""The 19,000 level also coincides with the 20-day EMA, which is another support it has. For initiating fresh longs, one should wait for the Index to stabilise around the 19,100-19,200 band,"" he stated.Among individual stocks, long trades were seen in Reliance, Jindal Steel, Hindalco Industries, and Tata Steel. While Hindustan Petroleum, India Cements, and PVR Inox saw short build-up.According to Rajesh Shrivastava, a derivatives trader, there is strong traction in ACC stock. After a long move, some solid positions are visible, and it is a key stock to track today in the derivatives space.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

"  July 10, 2023 / 11:04 AM IST  ",Top 10 trading ideas for 3-4 weeks as bull run may continue for now,"The market, despite Friday's correction, ended the last week on a positive note and continued upward rally for second consecutive week on July 7. The Nifty50 hit a fresh record high before getting into correction on Friday and settled tad above 19,300, down 0.85 percent, whereas for the week, it rallied 0.74 percent.The index has formed bullish candlestick pattern with long upper shadow on the weekly charts, indicating selling pressure or failure to sustain at record high levels, but the higher highs formation continued for 15th consecutive week, which is a positive sign.After the breakout of horizontal as well as upward sloping resistance trendlines in previous week ending June 30, the index sustained uptrend in following week, which is a positive sign. Overall, the index is likely to continue its march upwards amid consolidation with hurdle at 19,500-19,600 levels, whereas the near term support is expected to be 19,300-19,200 levels, followed by crucial support at 19,000, experts said.""We believe the bull run is likely to continue, marking the start of a major upward movement. However, the momentum on the upside may not match the intensity of the past couple of weeks. Considering the overbought conditions, we may witness a period of consolidation in the coming week, during which dips could be seen as buying opportunities,"" Sameet Chavan, head research, technical and derivatives at Angel One said.On the other hand, he advised to take secure profits at higher levels and avoid complacency until the indicators exit the overbought territory.In terms of support levels, the immediate support lies around 19,200, where a bullish gap was left last week, while the major breakout levels around 19,000-18,900 serve as a strong foundation for the market, Sameet said.As the prices are currently in uncharted territory, it is challenging to identify resistance zones, however, the range of 19,500-19,600 appears to be an immediate hurdle for the anticipated consolidation, he believes.Ajit Mishra, SVP - Technical Research at Religare Broking also sees consolidation, saying after the recent vertical up move in Nifty from 18,600 to 19,500 in no time, it is prudent for the index to spend some time around the current levels before marching further northwards.He expects Nifty to respect the 18,700-19,000 zone in case of any dip, while the 19,500-19,700 zone may act as a hurdle.Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the July 7 closing prices:Expert: Nagaraj Shetti, technical research analyst at HDFC SecuritiesGranules India: Buy | LTP: Rs 311.9 | Stop-Loss: Rs 289 | Targets: Rs 340-375 | Return: 20 percentThe attached weekly timeframe chart of Granules India indicates sustainable upside bounce in the last couple of weeks. The stock price is currently in an attempt of upside breakout of the hurdle at Rs 310 levels, which is neckline of double bottom formation. Hence, a sustainable upmove from here could bring sharp upside momentum for the stock price.We observe larger degree of higher bottom formation and the anticipated upmove could open renewed buying towards new higher top formation. Volume has started to expand during an attempt of upside breakout and weekly 14 period RSI (relative strength index) shows positive indication. The overall chart pattern of Granules indicates long trading opportunity.Buying can be initiated in Granules at CMP (Rs 311.9), add more on dips down to Rs 300, wait for the upside target of Rs 340 and next Rs 375 in 1 month, with a stop-loss of Rs 289.UPL: Sell | LTP: Rs 663 | Stop-Loss: Rs 702 | Target: Rs 615 | Return: 7 percentAfter showing narrow range movement in the last two months, the stock price has slipped into weakness from the highs and closed at the lower range of Rs 660 levels as per weekly chart.Weekly negative chart pattern like lower tops and bottoms is intact and the stock price is currently placed at the edge of downside breakout of the crucial support like ascending trend line at Rs 660 levels. Volume has started to expand on Friday during weakness in the stock price and the weekly 14 period RSI shows negative indication.One may look to sell UPL Ltd at CMP (Rs 663), add more on rise up to Rs 685 and wait for the downside target of Rs 615 in the next 1 month. Place a stop-loss of Rs 702.Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, head of equity research (retail) at Kotak SecuritiesLIC Housing Finance: Buy | LTP: Rs 390 | Stop-Loss: Rs 369 | Targets: Rs 430-450 | Return: 15 percentAfter a strong rally, currently the stock is witnessing rangebound activity. However, the medium term texture of the stock is still in to the positive side. Technically, on weekly charts, the stock has formed higher bottom formation and comfortably trading above 200 and 50-day SMA (simple moving average) which is largely positive.Unless it is trading below Rs 369, positional traders retain an optimistic stance and look for a target Rs 430-450. Fresh buying can be considered now and on dips, if any between Rs 390 and Rs 380 levels, with a stop-loss below Rs 369.Tata Steel: Buy | LTP: Rs 111.6 | Stop-Loss: Rs 106 | Targets: Rs 125-130 | Return: 16.5 percentAfter a quick short-term correction, the stock took the support near 200-day SMA and reversed. Post reversal, the stock is comfortably trading above 200-day SMA that is largely positive.

The Nifty50 hit a fresh record high before getting into correction on Friday and settled tad above 19,300, down 0.85 percent, whereas for the week, it rallied 0.74 percent.The index has formed bullish candlestick pattern with long upper shadow on the weekly charts, indicating selling pressure or failure to sustain at record high levels, but the higher highs formation continued for 15th consecutive week, which is a positive sign.After the breakout of horizontal as well as upward sloping resistance trendlines in previous week ending June 30, the index sustained uptrend in following week, which is a positive sign.

However, the momentum on the upside may not match the intensity of the past couple of weeks. Considering the overbought conditions, we may witness a period of consolidation in the coming week, during which dips could be seen as buying opportunities,"" Sameet Chavan, head research, technical and derivatives at Angel One said.On the other hand, he advised to take secure profits at higher levels and avoid complacency until the indicators exit the overbought territory.In terms of support levels, the immediate support lies around 19,200, where a bullish gap was left last week, while the major breakout levels around 19,000-18,900 serve as a strong foundation for the market, Sameet said.As the prices are currently in uncharted territory, it is challenging to identify resistance zones, however, the range of 19,500-19,600 appears to be an immediate hurdle for the anticipated consolidation, he believes.Ajit Mishra, SVP - Technical Research at Religare Broking also sees consolidation, saying after the recent vertical up move in Nifty from 18,600 to 19,500 in no time, it is prudent for the index to spend some time around the current levels before marching further northwards.He expects Nifty to respect the 18,700-19,000 zone in case of any dip, while the 19,500-19,700 zone may act as a hurdle.Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks.
