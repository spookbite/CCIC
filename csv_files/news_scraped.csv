Zee’s subscription revenue was up 3 percent in FY23 whereas Sony’s grew 15 percent YoY. “Sony outperformed Zee (in FY23) due to strength in the urban genre, sports properties, and OTT (over-the-top platform) price hikes,” said Karan Taurani, senior vice-president, Elara Capital.How the numbers stack upIn the television vertical, Sony and Zee had a market share of 9.1 percent and 10.4 percent, respectively, in FY23.

As for Zee, its ad and subscription revenue market share stood at 13.3 percent and 8.4 percent, respectively.The subscription market share of the combined entity stood at 16.4 percent in FY23. The merged entity, with 24 percent market share in advertising revenue, is only behind Star-Disney, which has a 33 percent share.On the streaming front, Sony India’s OTT platform SonyLIV currently has 33.3 million subscribers, while Zee’s streaming arm Zee5 reported 112 million average monthly active users (MAU) and 11.3 million daily active users (DAU) in FY23. According to industry estimates, Zee5’s subscriber base is pegged in the range of 5-10 million.In terms of financials, Sony recorded a profit after tax (PAT) of Rs 1,042 crore in FY23, up 6 percent YoY, whereas Zee’s PAT stood at Rs 251.4 crore, down 76 percent YoY. “Zee faced pressure mainly due to the content cost and its investments in digital,” Taurani noted.Zee’s and Sony’s combined revenue stood at Rs 14,772 crore in FY23.The combined entity’s annual revenue is estimated to be about $2 billion, said Mihir Shah, India head at Media Partners Asia, an advisory and consulting group.
