"  April 20, 2023 / 09:40 AM IST  ",ITC becomes 11th Indian firm to cross Rs 5-trillion market value,"Cigarettes-to-hotels conglomerate ITC Ltd became the 11th listed Indian company to cross Rs 5 trillion market capitalisation after its shares touched a record high with a 21 percent surge so far this year.The stock hit a record high of Rs 402.60 on BSE and gained as much as 1.1 percent intraday. At 9.30am, the stock traded at Rs 402.30, up 1.2 percent from its previous close, while its market cap stood at Rs5.01 trillion.Earlier, Reliance Industries Ltd, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, HDFC Ltd, Infosys Ltd, ICICI Bank Ltd, Hindustan Unilever Ltd, Life Insurance Corp Of India, State Bank of India, HDFC Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd have achieved this milestone.ITC's impressive performance across all its business segments, including FMCG, paper, and hotels, has made it an attractive choice for investors, especially given the current market challenges caused by  high inflation, unpredictable monsoon, continued weak rural sales, and delay in commodity costs decline.Investors see ITC as a defensive option due to its stable cash flow and dividends. Moreover, the company's strong operational performance, backed by double-digit growth in cigarette volume and a robust recovery in its hotels business, has further enhanced its appeal from a fundamental standpointAccording to analysts, despite facing an uncertain demand environment and persistent inflationary pressures on margins, ITC has demonstrated a resilient performance in the past few quarters. This resilience can be attributed to several factors, including the successful recovery of its core cigarette business in the post-Covid era, consistent double-digit growth in the non-cigarette FMCG business, and accelerated expansion in the hotel and paperboard, paper, and packaging (PPP) business.According to Motilal Oswal Securities, ITC’s earnings performance in the last couple of years and in FY24 shines like a beacon.  The brokerage house expects ITC has demonstrated a healthy 23 percent EPS growth in FY23 and we expect a likely EPS CAGR of 15 percent over the next two years as well. ITC’s earnings outlook is better than other large-cap staples players both on a two-year CAGR ending FY23 as well as FY24 earnings growth expectations.The Finance Bill 2023 has recently been amended, capping the maximum compensation cess on tobacco products at Rs 4,170 per 1,000 sticks plus 290 percent ad-valorem. Fortunately, ITC's cigarette business is not expected to be adversely affected by this change, analysts added.""We expect volume growth momentum in the cigarette business to continue in the quarters ahead. Going ahead, the non-cigarette FMCG business is expected to grow in double digits and its OPM (10 percent in Q3) is expected to consistently improve, while the hotel business will benefit from strong industry tailwinds in the coming years. Hence, compared to other large peers, ITC has much better earning visibility (15 percent CAGR over FY2022-FY2025),"" Sharekhan said in a recent note.Analysts said the ITC is predicted to sustain its volume growth momentum in the cigarette business due to the absence of any price hikes in the foreseeable future and the government's efforts to curb illicit cigarette sales. Additionally, the company's non-cigarette FMCG business is expected to continue its robust growth, the hotel business is set to experience a remarkable recovery, and the PPP business will maintain steady growth. As a result, ITC is anticipated to achieve double-digit revenue and PAT growth over the next two years.""The stock currently trades at 25.5x, 22.8x, and 20.6x its FY2023, FY2024, and FY2025 EPS, which is at a discount to some large consumer goods companies. With an improving growth outlook for its core cigarette business and margin expansion in the non-cigarette FMCG business, combined with strong cash-generation ability and robust dividend payouts, ITC is expected to enjoy a strong earnings visibility. These factors are likely to result in consistent improvement in the company's valuations over the next few years,"" the Sharekhan report added.",ITC Ltd.
"  April 20, 2023 / 09:30 AM IST  ","Paytm gets 'buy' rating from Motilal Oswal, 34% uptick on target price","Motilal Oswal Securities has given One97 Communications Ltd, the parent company of Paytm, a 'buy' rating with a target price of Rs 865 per share, representing a 34 percent increase from the current market price.Despite a slight slowdown due to Covid-19, Paytm has shown strong growth in its Gross Merchandise Value (GMV), with a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 55 percent from FY19-23. After Covid, the GMV has picked up significantly, clocking a CAGR of 81 percent from FY21-23. Motilal Oswal expects that the GMV will continue to record a healthy CAGR of 27 percent over FY23-25 due to increasing usage of Paytm.Paytm's Monthly Transaction Users (MTUs) have grown to 90 million as of FY23, while the number of subscription payment devices has risen to 6.8 million. As the penetration among merchants remains low, it is expected that Paytm's growth trajectory will continue, with an addition of 1 million devices per quarter. Payment revenue is expected to grow at a healthy 21% CAGR over FY23-25, Motilal said in its recent report.Paytm's financial business is expected to boost the profitability of its core payment business, as it has a higher contribution margin by nature. The proportion of financial services revenue has increased from 4 percent in FY19 to 19 percent in 9MFY23.Its lending business has shown strong growth in loan disbursals, with the total number of loans disbursed increasing 4.6x YoY in FY23. Motilal Oswal said that it is estimated that Paytm's loan disbursements will register a robust CAGR of 64 percent over FY23-25.Paytm achieved a breakeven in adjusted EBITDA during 3QFY23, ahead of its guidance. ""It is expected that Paytm will reach EBITDA break-even by FY25, with an EBITDA margin of 3.2 percent. The revenue and contribution profit of Paytm are estimated to grow at a CAGR of 26 percent and 32 percent over FY23-28,"" the brokerage firm said.",One 97 Communications Ltd.
