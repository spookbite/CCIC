Also, the stock-specific action given the earnings season is likely to be seen in the coming week.""The stock market trend has started to be impacted by the view and in anticipation of the heavy economic data, Fed policy, India Q3 results and Union Budget expectations,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial services said.Going ahead, he feels investors will focus on the muted Q3 earnings season along with the release of key macroeconomic data such as inflation. The market is expected to maintain a cautious trend during the month, the market expert said.Here are 10 key factors that will keep traders busy this week:1) Corporate EarningsIT majors will kick start the quarterly corporate earnings season this week. As per the earnings calendar available with stock exchanges, more than 60 companies will release their earnings scorecard.The country's largest software services exporter Tata Consultancy Services, being the first to open innings, will report its quarterly numbers today, which is likely to clock better performance than others. It will be followed by Infosys and HCL Technologies on Thursday, and Wipro on Friday, while the leading private sector lender HDFC Bank will announce its earnings on Saturday.Among others, Avenue Supermarts, 5paisa Capital, Cyient, Den Networks, Aditya Birla Money, and L&T Finance Holdings will also release their quarterly results.Analysts largely expect muted topline growth for large-cap IT companies due to slowdown in certain segments especially after deteriorating global environment along with furloughs higher than usual, while index heavyweight HDFC Bank is expected to report around 18-20 odd percent YoY growth in net interest income, profit and loan book.""We forecast sequential revenue growth of 0-3 percent in constant currency for our coverage universe. Cross-currency tailwinds will range from 10-60 bps. On YoY comparison, we expect revenue growth to moderate to high-single digit to low-teens,"" Kotak Institutional Equities said.""The slowdown in specific segments of the market such as mortgages, hi-tech, segments of retail and telecoms will lead to a moderation. The slowdown is in sync with the deterioration in external environment. Furloughs have been higher than usual, especially in the hi-tech segment,"" the brokerage added.2) CPI InflationCPI inflation for the month of December is another key factor that market participants will watch out for. It is a data point for the Reserve Bank of India to take interest rate decision call over the next policy meeting scheduled in February 2023. Analysts largely expect steady number for last month of 2022 despite falling food prices, with sticky core data at around 6 percent which generally implies inflation is expected to remain as a priority for RBI.""After a surprise return to the target band in November, we expect CPI inflation to remain broadly steady, coming in at 5.96 percent YoY in December, modestly up from 5.88 percent YoY in November,"" Barclays India said.Retail inflation, which is measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), dropped to 11-month low at 5.88 percent in November, falling from 6.77 percent in previous month.The research house expects core inflation to modestly edge down to 6.0 percent YoY, after seven straight months of registering ~6.2 percent prints. ""Still, this was likely driven by the impact of a higher base kicking in, even as reviving domestic demand likely kept price pressures relatively elevated. A seasonal drop in housing prices is likely to be offset by sticky education and health inflation.""Industrial and manufacturing production data for November will also be released on coming Thursday. Apart from this, foreign exchange reserves for week ended January 6, bank loan & deposit growth for fortnight ended December 30, and balance of trade numbers for December will be released on Friday.3) US InflationGlobally the key number to watch out for, would be US inflation scheduled to be announced on coming Thursday. Overall experts expect the world's largest economy to report inflation for December in the range of 6.5-7 percent, falling from 7.1 percent in November (the lowest since December 2021). In fact, the inflation rate has consistently been falling for fifth month in November.Given it is still far above the targetted inflation rate of 2 percent, the US Federal Reserve is expected to continue with rate hike cycle as Fed officials in their latest FOMC minutes hinted for more rate hikes to control inflation. In December 2022 meeting, the Fed raised the federal funds rate to 4.25-4.50 percent, up by 50 bps.The speeach by Fed Chair Jerome Powell scheduled on Tuesday will also be closely watched by global investors next week.4) Global Macroeconomic DataHere are key global macroeconomic data points to watch out for next week:5) FII FlowForeign institutional investors continued to be net sellers in the first week of 2023, especially may be after hawkish tone by Fed officials, though domestic institutional investors managed to offset the outflow to some extent. Hence, unless and until FIIs flow return strongly, the stellar rally in equity markets is unlikely to be seen though DIIs have supported markets to major extent.FIIs have net sold more than Rs 7,800 crore worth shares during the week, in addition to around Rs 14,000 crore of selling in December 2022, whereas the net buying by DIIs was around Rs 2,700 crore on top of over Rs 24,000 crore of equity purchases in previous month.6) ListingSah Polymers, the customised bulk packaging solutions provider to several industries, is set to make its grand debut on the bourses next week on Thursday. Its Rs 66-crore public issue received healthy response from investors, subscribing 17.5 times backed largely by retail investors and high networth individuals.In the grey market, its IPO shares are available with moderate premium of 4-8 percent over its expected final issue price of Rs 65, analysts said. The recent correction and volatility in equity markets as well as disappointed listings of recent IPOs might have impacted the grey market premium.7) Technical ViewThe Nifty50 has decisively broken psychological 18,000 mark during the last week but has taken a support at December low of around 17,750, which is expected to act as a crucial level to watch coming week as breaking of the same could drag the index towards 17,500, with hurdle on upper side would be 18,000-18,200 area. The closing level on Friday was 17,859.50.On the daily scale, now the index traded below 50 EMA (exponential moving average - 18,144), as well as 100 EMA (17,884) and now if it stays below these levels and corrected futher then 200 EMA (17,468) would be in jeopardy, experts said.Also there was bearish candle formation on the weekly as well daily time frames, indicating nervousness among traders.""The current data still supports the fact that the psychological support around 17,500 would come under jeopardy due to its close proximity to its 200-day EMA level which could be marked as key support zone for the ongoing bearish move,"" Sacchitanand Uttekar, VP-Research (Derivatives & Technicals) at Tradebulls Securities said.8) F&O CuesOn the weekly basis, we have seen maximum Call open interest at 18,000 strike followed by 19,000 strike, and 18,100-18,200 strikes, with Call writing at 18,000 strike, then 17,900 strike.On the Put side, the maximum Put open interest was seen at 18,000 strike, followed by 17,500 strike, with writing at 17,000 strike then 17,600 strike. The Option data indicated that the 18,000 is expected to be crucial near term resistance for the Nifty50, whereas 17,500 is likely to support area.The overall expected trading range for the Nifty50 would be 17,600-18,200 in coming sessions.9) India VIXThe volatility remained on the slightly higher side, giving discomfort for bulls in last several days. Unless and until volatility drops and sustains below 14 mark the consolidation is expected to continue in the market, and generally ahead of key event Union Budget 2023, the volatility remains high, hence which is also expected to be watched this time, experts said.India VIX was up by 1 odd percent during the last week, from 14.86 to 15.02 levels.10) Corporate ActionHere are key corporate actions taking place in the coming week:",HCL Technologies Ltd.

The major trend-deciding level remains at 18,300, which would turn the tide once again in favour of bulls, he said.The market expert advised traders to keep a close tab on all these scenarios. The only positive takeaway at the end of the week would be the resilience of the broader market, he feels.Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the January 6 closing prices:Expert: Nandish Shah, Senior Derivative and Technical Analyst at HDFC SecuritiesReligare Enterprises: Buy | LTP: Rs 176.35 | Stop-Loss: Rs 164 | Target: Rs 190-199 | Return: 13 percentAfter breaking out from the downward sloping trendline on the daily chart, stock price is consolidating during last few days, indicating relative strength in the stock.

One can buy the stock in the range of Rs 176.35-170.Sundram Fasteners: Buy | LTP: Rs 991 | Stop-Loss: Rs 920 | Target: Rs 1,070-1,100 | Return: 11 percentThe stock price has broken out on the weekly chart from the multiple top resistance of Rs 980-985 levels.

The stock is following a bullish formation, which crossed Rs 1,270 level in October 2022.Based on the short-term formation of the stock, technically, it is moving towards Rs 1,500-1,550 levels. Buy at the current level and place a stop-loss at Rs 1,390.Hindalco Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 462.65 | Stop-Loss: Rs 450 | Target: Rs 491 | Return: 6 percentAfter making several bottoms between 425 and 430, the stock quickly reversed to Rs 491 levels. A sector-specific move supported the rally in the stock on strong gains in Asian markets.Last week, the stock fell to Rs 460 level due to continued weakness in the US market. At current levels, the stock is attractive to buy from a trading point of view. However, a stop-loss at Rs 450 is required.Tata Consultancy Services: Sell | LTP: Rs 3,211.55 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,300 | Target: Rs 3,175-3,100 | Return: 3.5 percentThe stock has formed a series of falling tops and falling bottoms, which is a bearish formation. The levels of Rs 3,300 and Rs 3,400 are acting as major resistance zone for the stock.On Friday, the stock closed below the level of Rs 3250, which would pull the stock to Rs 3,175 or Rs 3,100 in the near term.

Continuing its prior weekly falling trend, the stock slipped to 11-week low during the last week.Its weekly RSI slipped below 50-mark post negative cross-over. This could drag the stock towards its psychological level of Rs 700, where its lowest level of May 2022 and June 2022 are also placed.In case of any pullback, the stock may face hurdle around its extending trendline.DLF: Sell | LTP: Rs 370 | Stop-Loss: Rs 387 | Target: Rs 346 | Return: 6.5 percentThe stock resumed its down move post a pullback. On the higher side, the stock faced hurdle around the junction of key moving averages on the daily timeframe chart.Its daily RSI reversed before testing 50-mark. We believe undergoing negative momentum may continue, which could drag the stock towards its lowest level of September 2022.On the higher side, its key moving averages will cap the up-move.Tata Power: Sell | LTP: Rs 205.4 | Stop-Loss: Rs 213 | Target: Rs 190 | Return: 7.5 percentThe stock reversed after testing its prior point of polarity and moved down. Its major moving averages are sloping downwards and the key technical indicators are negatively poised.This could drag the stock towards its lowest level of June 2021.In case of any rebound, the stock will continue to face hurdle around its prior point of polarity.Expert: Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisaPetronet LNG: Buy | LTP: Rs 218 | Stop-Loss: Rs 206 | Target: Rs 235-240 | Return: 10 percentThe stock has seen a long consolidation phase and has traded within a broad range since last three years and has now given a breakout from a falling trendline resistance. Off late, the stock has witnessed positive momentum as the ‘89 DEMA’ has acted as a support during the recent decline.The volumes during price corrections are low while they are rising gradually along with price upmoves indicating buying interest by market participants. The RSI Smoothed oscillator has given a positive crossover on the daily chart and is in ‘Buy Mode’ on the weekly charts too.Considering the technical structure, we expect the stock to rally higher in the near term and hence, short term traders can look for buying opportunities around current price of Rs 218. The possible near term targets for the stock are expected around Rs 235-240, while the stop-loss for long positions should be placed below Rs 206.Bajaj Auto: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,642 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,540 | Target: Rs 3,740-3,800 | Return: 4 percentThe stock has been consolidating within a range since last few weeks and prices have seen some pullback move from the support end of a ‘Symmetrical Triangle’ pattern. The stock has relatively shown strength as compared to broader markets since last few days and the RSI oscillator has given a positive crossover indicating a positive momentum.Traders can look to buy the stock in the range of Rs 3,640-3,620 for potential targets around Rs 3,740 and Rs 3,800.

It will be followed by Infosys and HCL Technologies on Thursday, and Wipro on Friday, while the leading private sector lender HDFC Bank will announce its earnings on Saturday.Among others, Avenue Supermarts, 5paisa Capital, Cyient, Den Networks, Aditya Birla Money, and L&T Finance Holdings will also release their quarterly results.Analysts largely expect muted topline growth for large-cap IT companies due to slowdown in certain segments especially after deteriorating global environment along with furloughs higher than usual, while index heavyweight HDFC Bank is expected to report around 18-20 odd percent YoY growth in net interest income, profit and loan book.""We forecast sequential revenue growth of 0-3 percent in constant currency for our coverage universe. Cross-currency tailwinds will range from 10-60 bps. On YoY comparison, we expect revenue growth to moderate to high-single digit to low-teens,"" Kotak Institutional Equities said.""The slowdown in specific segments of the market such as mortgages, hi-tech, segments of retail and telecoms will lead to a moderation. The slowdown is in sync with the deterioration in external environment. Furloughs have been higher than usual, especially in the hi-tech segment,"" the brokerage added.2) CPI InflationCPI inflation for the month of December is another key factor that market participants will watch out for. It is a data point for the Reserve Bank of India to take interest rate decision call over the next policy meeting scheduled in February 2023. Analysts largely expect steady number for last month of 2022 despite falling food prices, with sticky core data at around 6 percent which generally implies inflation is expected to remain as a priority for RBI.""After a surprise return to the target band in November, we expect CPI inflation to remain broadly steady, coming in at 5.96 percent YoY in December, modestly up from 5.88 percent YoY in November,"" Barclays India said.Retail inflation, which is measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), dropped to 11-month low at 5.88 percent in November, falling from 6.77 percent in previous month.The research house expects core inflation to modestly edge down to 6.0 percent YoY, after seven straight months of registering ~6.2 percent prints. ""Still, this was likely driven by the impact of a higher base kicking in, even as reviving domestic demand likely kept price pressures relatively elevated. A seasonal drop in housing prices is likely to be offset by sticky education and health inflation.""Industrial and manufacturing production data for November will also be released on coming Thursday. Apart from this, foreign exchange reserves for week ended January 6, bank loan & deposit growth for fortnight ended December 30, and balance of trade numbers for December will be released on Friday.3) US InflationGlobally the key number to watch out for, would be US inflation scheduled to be announced on coming Thursday. Overall experts expect the world's largest economy to report inflation for December in the range of 6.5-7 percent, falling from 7.1 percent in November (the lowest since December 2021). In fact, the inflation rate has consistently been falling for fifth month in November.Given it is still far above the targetted inflation rate of 2 percent, the US Federal Reserve is expected to continue with rate hike cycle as Fed officials in their latest FOMC minutes hinted for more rate hikes to control inflation. In December 2022 meeting, the Fed raised the federal funds rate to 4.25-4.50 percent, up by 50 bps.The speeach by Fed Chair Jerome Powell scheduled on Tuesday will also be closely watched by global investors next week.4) Global Macroeconomic DataHere are key global macroeconomic data points to watch out for next week:5) FII FlowForeign institutional investors continued to be net sellers in the first week of 2023, especially may be after hawkish tone by Fed officials, though domestic institutional investors managed to offset the outflow to some extent. Hence, unless and until FIIs flow return strongly, the stellar rally in equity markets is unlikely to be seen though DIIs have supported markets to major extent.FIIs have net sold more than Rs 7,800 crore worth shares during the week, in addition to around Rs 14,000 crore of selling in December 2022, whereas the net buying by DIIs was around Rs 2,700 crore on top of over Rs 24,000 crore of equity purchases in previous month.6) ListingSah Polymers, the customised bulk packaging solutions provider to several industries, is set to make its grand debut on the bourses next week on Thursday. Its Rs 66-crore public issue received healthy response from investors, subscribing 17.5 times backed largely by retail investors and high networth individuals.In the grey market, its IPO shares are available with moderate premium of 4-8 percent over its expected final issue price of Rs 65, analysts said. The recent correction and volatility in equity markets as well as disappointed listings of recent IPOs might have impacted the grey market premium.7) Technical ViewThe Nifty50 has decisively broken psychological 18,000 mark during the last week but has taken a support at December low of around 17,750, which is expected to act as a crucial level to watch coming week as breaking of the same could drag the index towards 17,500, with hurdle on upper side would be 18,000-18,200 area. The closing level on Friday was 17,859.50.On the daily scale, now the index traded below 50 EMA (exponential moving average - 18,144), as well as 100 EMA (17,884) and now if it stays below these levels and corrected futher then 200 EMA (17,468) would be in jeopardy, experts said.Also there was bearish candle formation on the weekly as well daily time frames, indicating nervousness among traders.""The current data still supports the fact that the psychological support around 17,500 would come under jeopardy due to its close proximity to its 200-day EMA level which could be marked as key support zone for the ongoing bearish move,"" Sacchitanand Uttekar, VP-Research (Derivatives & Technicals) at Tradebulls Securities said.8) F&O CuesOn the weekly basis, we have seen maximum Call open interest at 18,000 strike followed by 19,000 strike, and 18,100-18,200 strikes, with Call writing at 18,000 strike, then 17,900 strike.On the Put side, the maximum Put open interest was seen at 18,000 strike, followed by 17,500 strike, with writing at 17,000 strike then 17,600 strike. The Option data indicated that the 18,000 is expected to be crucial near term resistance for the Nifty50, whereas 17,500 is likely to support area.The overall expected trading range for the Nifty50 would be 17,600-18,200 in coming sessions.9) India VIXThe volatility remained on the slightly higher side, giving discomfort for bulls in last several days. Unless and until volatility drops and sustains below 14 mark the consolidation is expected to continue in the market, and generally ahead of key event Union Budget 2023, the volatility remains high, hence which is also expected to be watched this time, experts said.India VIX was up by 1 odd percent during the last week, from 14.86 to 15.02 levels.10) Corporate ActionHere are key corporate actions taking place in the coming week:",Tata Consultancy Services Ltd.
