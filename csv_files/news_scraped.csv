"  August 25, 2023 / 09:38 AM IST  ",India Inc’s Q1 scorecard: Only 7 Nifty companies earned more than Barbie,"India Inc’s June quarter results season is done and dusted, with investors and analysts combing through the numbers with laser-sharp focus. But do you know how corporate India stacks up against global markets? Or which Nifty company posted the least net profit? Or just how much is the aggregate revenue of the country’s top 50 firms?Here are some charts to break down India Inc’s Q1 show:BarbillionGreta Gerwig’s pink-hued fantasy film Barbie has not only become a global phenomenon but also set the box office cash registers ringing. The Margot Robbie-starrer has amassed over $1.2 billion (about Rs 9,950 crore) in worldwide ticket sales, so far, breaking the record for female directors.This figure is also higher than the first quarter net profit of most Indian corporate giants.Many market purists will scoff at the idea of comparing a film’s box office collections (revenue) with a company’s net profit. So here’s another statistic – with an estimated budget of $145 million, Barbie has already generated an ROI of over 700 percent. How many companies can boast of such returns on their invested capital?Apple of my eyeThe world’s most profitable company lording over its peers is hardly a secret. The only question is — by how much?Here’s a sobering statistic. At $19.4 billion, Apple’s net profit for the June quarter is comparable to the profit of all the Nifty50 companies combined ($23.34 billion, or Rs 1.94 lakh crore).The Cupertino, California-headquartered tech behemoth posted revenue of $83 billion for the three months to June. This compares with the cumulative topline of $200 billion (Rs 16.63 lakh crore) of the Nifty50 firms.Apple's iPhone sales alone aggregate to a whopping $40.68 billion.Food for thoughtConsumers in the US spent an estimated $47 billion on pizzas last year. Extrapolating the figure in quarterly terms, the figure is almost half of the Nifty50 firms’ Q1 net profit.Here’s another nugget to chew on.Brazilian football superstar Neymar’s contract with Saudi Pro League club Al Hilal is worth a staggering $400 million a year, according to reports. This includes his base salary as well as a host of commercial deals.Breaking down the numbers, Neymar’s quarterly earnings (around Rs 825 crore) in Saudi Arabia are more than the Q1 net profit of 14 Nifty companies, including Adani Enterprises, Apollo Hospitals, UPL, Titan and Tata Steel.LeaderboardSBI has overtaken market heavyweight Reliance Industries in terms of quarterly net profit. Only seven companies have posted net profit in excess of Rs 10,000 crore in Q1 FY24.The company with the lowest net profit in the Nifty pack is UPL at Rs 159 crore.Disclosure: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

"  August 25, 2023 / 06:39 AM IST  ","Hot Stocks | Mahindra Holidays, Sun TV, Mphasis may deliver in double digits in short term","The Nifty has exhibited some interesting price action recently. It found strong support around 19,230 levels, which was the previous month's low, and saw a significant rebound, indicating a robust demand at lower levels.However, when we analyse the index on both weekly and daily charts, we observe mixed signals. On the weekly charts, the index has formed a higher-high-higher-low pattern, suggesting a bullish trend. But on the daily charts, it faced resistance at the 20-day simple moving average (SMA), and formed a bearish engulfing candle pattern in terms of its body, signalling selling pressure at higher levels. This discrepancy indicates uncertainty in the short to medium term.The relative strength index (RSI), a momentum indicator, is declining and remains below the 50 mark on the daily charts. This implies a weakening positive momentum for the index in the short term.In terms of support and resistance levels, the index has strong support at 19,234, corresponding to the previous month's low, with a key support level at 18,887 following closely. Potential resistance levels include 19,645, representing the high of the past three weeks, and 19,991, which is the all-time high.Given these conditions, it appears that the Nifty Index is currently in a rangebound trend between 19,234 – 19,645 levels in the short to medium term, as long as it stays above the 19,234 levels. A breach of this immediate support could push it lower toward the 18,887 levels.Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks:Mahindra Holidays and Resorts India: Buy | LTP: Rs 395.60 | Stop-Loss: Rs 380 | Target: Rs 440 | Return: 11 percentMahindra Holidays has been on a consistent ascent within its rising channel, marking continuous higher highs and higher lows, reflecting a bullish sentiment.It's worth noting that the stock demonstrates a pronounced breakout from an Inverse Head & Shoulder pattern, hinting at a potential prolonged uptrend. This pattern is especially prominent near the channel's support level.Additionally, the stock's prices have consistently positioned themselves above the 12-day exponential moving average (EMA) — a time-tested metric for dynamic support.Reinforcing this optimistic view, the MACD (moving average convergence divergence) momentum indicator signals a range transition, accentuating the stock's burgeoning momentum.Looking ahead, it's plausible to anticipate an upward movement in the stock's prices, potentially reaching a level of Rs 440. It's advisable to set a stop-loss at Rs 380 based on daily closing prices, to mitigate potential losses.Sun TV Network: Buy | LTP: Rs 582.55 | Stop-Loss: Rs 560 | Target: Rs 660 | Return: 13 percentThe stock has witnessed a significant breakout from a multi-year resistance level, positioned around Rs 574 mark, a barrier that has held since October 2018. This upward shift is accompanied by heightened trading volume, pointing to strong investor interest in this surge.On examining the daily charts, a Saucer pattern breakout further accentuates the stock's bullish potential, hinting at an intensified upward momentum.In the present context, the stock maintains a positive stance above key metrics like the 12-day and 26-day EMAs, reinforcing the bullish narrative. When assessing momentum, the MACD indicator portrays a vibrant positive surge, marked by a favorable crossover above its baseline.Looking ahead, there is an expectation that the stock's price will persist in its ascent until it reaches Rs 660 level. It's advisable to implement a stop-loss at Rs 560, based on a closing basisMphasis: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,464 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,320 | Target: Rs 2,825 | Return: 14 percentMphasis stock is currently trading at its 52-week high, indicating a robust positive sentiment for the medium to long term. Additionally, recent market activity reveals a Bullish Flag pattern breakout with substantial trading volume confirmation, affirming an ongoing uptrend.Moreover, the daily charts demonstrate a notable breakout from a consolidation pattern, providing further support for the stock's positive outlook. Notably, the stock has also undergone a Change in Polarity (CIP) around the 2220 price level, signifying a potential shift in its market dynamics.Furthermore, both the weekly and daily RSI indicators are trending upwards and holding above the 65 level. This signals the presence of substantial positive momentum in the stock's price movement.Based on these technical indicators, the expected price movement suggests that the stock has the potential to advance towards Rs 2,825 price level. To manage risk effectively, it's advisable to set a prudent stop-loss level at Rs 2,320 on closing basis.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.
