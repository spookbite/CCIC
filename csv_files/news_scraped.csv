""While Q1 is historically a weak quarter, the revenue trajectory this time around should improve backed by the commencement of commercial supplies for a Sartan product and possibly the custom synthesis product, for which customer qualifications were completed last quarter,"" the brokerage said.On the expectation of a margin recovery, Nuvama estimates the EBITDA margin at 30.6 percent for the April-June period that is substantially lower than its historical run-rate of 34-35 percent.Going ahead, Prabhudas Lilladher believes the management's outlook on margins and growth in its custom synthesis business will remain key monitorables for Divi's Labs.Expectations of subdued earnings on a year-on-year basis also dented the investor sentiment.
