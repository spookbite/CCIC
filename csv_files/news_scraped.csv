However, the carrier has benefited from a strong post-pandemic recovery in domestic air travel in the world's third-largest aviation market.While IndiGo is also expected to benefit from the turmoil at smaller rival Go First, which filed for bankruptcy earlier this month, it also faces increased competition from new entrant Akasa Air and Tata Group, which took over Air India.Shares of IndiGo on Thursday (May 18) closed 1,57 percent lower at Rs 2,264 apiece on BSE.",InterGlobe Aviation Ltd.

RM cost pressure (cheese) may continue for a few quarters and the management indicated that it may refrain from price hikes as the near-term environment looks challenging.The new CEO’s efforts on improving dine-in LFL growth, his decision not to hike prices amid the transient high-cost environment in wheat and cheese, and building the technological and analytical edge of the company are welcome moves that will create value in the medium term.Motilal Oswal believes there are strong long-term opportunities in QSR and the company with its moats is poised to take advantage of the same.After a steep stock price correction of ~25 percent from its peak, valuations appear reasonable at ~28x FY25E EV/EBITDA for a business that has ROE superior to QSR peers and other retail companies.It reiterates Buy rating with a Target Price of Rs 560 (premised on 32x FY25E Pre Ind-AS EBITDA).SharekhanThough discretionary demand is expected to remain uncertain in the near term, the company’s renewed strategies would help LFL growth to gradually improve ahead.Sharekhan likes JFL’s strategy of investing in core and new ventures to scale up business growth and revenue without comprising profitability in the long run.A brand-wise differentiated strategy, aggressive store additions, improving customer experience on the delivery platform, sustained innovation, and customer-centric offerings will drive growth in the medium-long term.The stock has corrected by 26 percent from its high and is 59x/41.5x its FY2024E/FY2025E earnings.The broking house maintains its 'Buy' rating on the stock with an unchanged price target (PT) of Rs 600.Nirmal BangJubilant FoodWorks’ standalone 4QFY23 operating performance came in below Nirmal Bang's estimate.The company is not looking at further price increases in the near term and will absorb incremental inflation (if any), along with continued optimization of costs.Changes to our model have led to 21.5 percent/30.1 percent and 18.6 percent/28.1 percent cut in our Pre Ind-AS EBITDA and Post Ind-AS EBITDA estimates, respectively for FY24E/FY25E, largely reflecting muted LFL growth and an adverse near term impact on profitability, especially in the current uncertain demand environment for discretionary products, said Nirmal Bang.While it continues to be believers in the long-term opportunity for the company, the ongoing reset to near-term numbers and fair valuation on the revised FY25E Pre Ind-AS EBITDA lead to downgrading the stock to Accumulate.The stock is now trading at ~33x/28x FY24E/FY25E Pre-Ind AS EBITDA. Nirmal Bang assign a target multiple of 30x on FY25E Pre-Ind AS EBITDA and arrive at a target price (TP) of Rs 495.UBSThe brokerage firm has issued a buy rating on Jubilant FoodWorks with a target price of Rs 600 per share. The weak demand continued in Q4FY23 and expect near-term pain in both demand and margins to continue.UBS believes that the long-term growth potential remains intact, and new brands to support the growth.Morgan StanleyMorgan Stanley has given an Overweight rating to the stock and kept a target price at Rs 560 per share. The Q4 was a miss on margin, although tad better than peers. Additionally, revenue, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), and net profit growth were below estimates, and both gross and EBITDA margins were down.CLSAThe research firm assigned a sell rating to the stock with a target price of Rs 460 per share. Inflation and high competition are weighing on demand.CLSA highlights that margins have dropped to the lowest level in 11 quarters.
