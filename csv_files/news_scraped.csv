While core PAT at Rs115.4bn was 3.7% short of PLe due to higher opex, asset quality surprised positively with lower GNPA led by lesser slippages, despite Q1 being usually weak. Loan growth was softer at 0.5% QoQ driven by IBPC sell-down since bank would like to manage its PSL requirement in a calibrated manner. Quality of growth was superior as credit offtake QoQ was led by retail and CRB. Bank sounded confident of achieving a 18% YoY loan growth (merged) over medium term though we are factoring 16% due to likely deposit need. Benign asset quality environment may keep opex elevated in near term and for FY24/25E we raise opex by 5% but reduce provisions by 15/9bps, which will not change PAT materially. NII and core PPoP trend compared to peers would be keenly watched.OutlookWe maintain multiple at 3.0x on FY25E core ABV and TP at Rs2,025.

At the same time NII growth was tepid sequentially (21.1% YoY, 1.1% QoQ) against the loan growth (15.8% YoY, 0.9% QoQ). The bank reported stable NIMs at 4.3%. A marginally higher opex (C/I ratio: 42.8% v/s 42%) and lackluster NII growth led to sequential decline in PPOP. Thus, the bank has reported sequential decrease in PAT by 0.8% along with ROA/ROE of 2.04%/16.3%.OutlookWe expect marginal reduction in ROA/ROE for FY24E owing to higher C/I ratio and margin pressure.

The lender’s NII stood at Rs 4,669.5 crore in the three months to March 2023, with net interest margin (NIM) at 4.28 percent.“The bank is expected to deliver improved performance across business parameters in 1Q FY24, which will help it to deliver strong RoA (return on assets) led by healthy growth in loan book and stable NIM,” analysts at domestic brokerage Ashika said.“We expect NIM to remain comfortable on the back of greater proportion of consumer loan sector, stabilization of deposit cost and decrease in future risk cost. Loan growth has gradually improved over the last few quarters,” they said.Shares of IndusInd Bank were trading 0.51 percent up at Rs 1,399.70 on the BSE at 10.15am. The shares are up 14 percent on a year-to-date basis, while the one-year return stands at 64 percent.Q1 business updateIn its business update for the first quarter of this fiscal, IndusInd Bank clocked a 21 percent rise in net advances to Rs 3.01 lakh crore, as against Rs 2.47 lakh crore a year back. On a sequential basis, advances increased 4 percent.Deposits also grew 15 percent on-year to Rs 3.47 lakh crore and 3 percent on-quarter.

You just need to have them in your portfolio. You can’t go much wrong there.

As a result, it hopes to see substantial upgrades in earnings for these companies. Nomura has a 'buy' rating on the OMCs.In a recent interview with Moneycontrol, Gaurav Dua, Senior VP and Head of Capital Market Strategy at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas, said that he expect the OMCs to report Rs 40,000 crore of combined profits in Q1 FY2024 as compared to a net loss of Rs 18,500 crore a year back.Reuters Singapore refining margins increased 24 percent to $5.4 a barrel in the week ended July 16 from $4.3 in the previous week, led by an increase in spreads across all products except for fuel oil. In the second quarter of FY24, the Reuters Singapore complex refining margin increased to $4.9/bbl, from $4.1/bbl in 1QFY24, the Nomura Report said.Diesel spreads increased 9 percent to $18.5/bbl from $17/bbl in the previous week,  Gasoline spreads increased 5 percent on-week to $14.7/bbl,  Jet fuel and kerosene margins jumped 20 percent on-week to $16.4/bbl from $13.7/bbl, naphtha margins increased to -$17.7/bbl on-week from -$20.5/bbl, while  fuel-oil (FO) margins declined to -$11.5/bbl from -$7.8/bbl in the previous week, the Nomura report added.Blended marketing margins declined to Rs 9.9/litre in the week ended July 16 from Rs 10.8 a week back, remaining sharply above the normative levels of Rs 3/litre,  diesel marketing margins declined to Rs 9.9/litre from Rs 11 in the previous week, while marketing margins for gasoline moderated 1 percent on-week to Rs 9.8/litre from Rs 9.9/litre.According to Prabhudas Lilladher, Indian Oil sector’s operating profit is expected to increase by 17.7 percent on-quarter to Rs 832 billion, given the robust performance by the OMCs with EBITDA at Rs 383 billion, led by improving marketing margins (blended margin of Rs 9 vs Rs 3 in Q4) despite lower refining spreads.

The benchmark Sensex gained 0.35 percent to 6,6828 points.Tata Chemicals acquired 4.99 percent stake in Rallis India at Rs 215.05 a share and the total deal was valued at Rs 208.60 crore. The acquisition has raised Tata Chemicals' stake in Rallis to 55.04 percent from 50.06 percent.The company recently reported a 5 percent on-year drop in net profit at Rs 63 crore for the April-June quarter, while its revenue from operations too declined 9 percent to Rs 782 crore over the last year.Rallis India’s profit numbers were pulled down by its crop care segment, which procured low business on account of delayed monsoon and easing fertiliser costs. Revenue from the crop care business fell 9 percent on-year in Q1FY24, the company said in an analyst call presentation.The Rallies India management offered a cautious outlook for FY2024 exports, while brokerage firm Kotak Institutional Equities see erratic rainfall as a risk to the company's domestic growth. ""We revise the FY2024/25 EPS up by 6 percent each and remain cautious with a June 2024 FV of Rs220 (18X June 2025E P/E),"" Kotak said.Rallis, in its 1QFY24 report, experienced a 9 percent year-on-year decline in revenues. Despite this, the company effectively minimised the decline in EBITDA to just 2 percent through strategic measures such as optimising the product mix, controlling operating expenses, and implementing pricing actions.Looking ahead, the management remains cautious about the exports business, anticipating a gradual recovery in the second half of FY2024 once channel inventories ease out. However, there is more positive sentiment surrounding the domestic business due to the recent increase in monsoon rainfall, which has been viewed as a favourable indicator.""We would remain cautious, considering the very erratic spatial distribution of rainfall witnessed thus far — with northern India facing floods and the south and west of the country experiencing rainfall deficits—as well as risks of El Niño-related disruptions. On the margin front, falling input costs are unlikely to boost margins as customers demand reductions in finished product prices amid what is currently a buyer’s market given oversupply out of China. Price declines could well continue to weigh on margins in coming quarters,"" Kotak said in its latest report.Kotak has expressed concerns about the agrochemical industry, stating that channel inventories continue to be at elevated levels in crucial regions. Although crop prices are favourable and expected to support farmer demand, the agrochemical business remains heavily dependent on climate conditions. Looking forward, the outlook for FY2024 is uncertain due to apprehensions about the potential impact of El Niño.""Aside from these near-term uncertainties, the structural problems that Rallis continues to grapple with are — (1) its genericised product portfolio and (2) its heavy reliance on China for raw materials. While the management is making efforts to address both these challenges, any significant positive results may take years to become visible. Inin this backdrop, valuations are still not attractive enough to warrant a positive stance, in our view,"" the Kotak report said.",Tata Chemicals Ltd.
"  July 18, 2023 / 11:25 AM IST  ","Maruti a ‘sell’, and so too Tata Motors now, says Kotak Institutional","Kotak Institutional Equities has retained the 'sell' rating on Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and downgraded Tata Motors Ltd to 'sell' from 'reduce' after the recent rally in the stocks. The brokerage house also said that the muted trend in the passenger vehicle segment remains a cause for concern.Since the start of April, Maruti Suzuki India zoomed 18 percent, while Tata Motors surged over 52 percent.Kotak has revised the target price on Maruti to Rs 8,150 from Rs 7,850 a share, while for Tata Motors, it has revised the revised target price to Rs 550 from Rs 530 a share.The broker predicts that Maruti Suzuki's market share will stay at 41.5-42 percent, even with the launch of SUV and MUV models. It anticipates the company's market share to remain stable in the hatchback and sedan segments, while showing a slight decrease in the MUV segment.""In the SUV segment, we expect the company’s market share to improve to 18 percent in FY2024 from 12 percent a year ago, led by market share gain in the micro-SUV (Fronx), mid-size SUV (Grand Vitara) and large SUV segments (Jimny). However, we expect the company’s market share to decline 50-60 bps over FY2025-26, mainly owing to the competition in the SUV segment. Despite gain in the SUV segment, Maruti Suzuki’s market share is expected to remain flat due to a decline in the hatchback segment’s mix, where Maruti Suzuki has above 70 percent market share,"" the Kotak report said.Kotak forecasts that Tata Motors' market share will decrease by 50 basis points (bps) year-on-year in FY2024, primarily because of heightened competition in the micro-SUV segment, where Maruti Suzuki Fronx and Hyundai Exter are expected to intensify the competition. However, this decline will partly be offset by gains in the hatchback segment, resulting from the introduction of CNG and EV trims for existing models.In FY2024, Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) is likely to experience a 60 basis points (bps) on-year improvement in market share, reaching 9.8 percent. This growth is attributed to the company's robust order backlog and the limited competition it faces in the large SUV segment, which contributes significantly to its overall volumes. On the other hand, Hyundai Motors is expected to witness a slight increase in market share from FY2023 to FY2026. This growth will be driven primarily by the launch of the micro-SUV Exter at a competitive price point, helping the company to strengthen its position in the market, the Kotak report added.Kotak anticipates a 4 percent year-on-year growth in the domestic passenger vehicle (PV) industry volumes for FY2024. This growth will be driven by persistent weakness in the entry-level car segment and a decline in pent-up demand.The brokerage house forecasts that market shares of passenger vehicle industry players will remain stable from FY2024 to FY2026. This steadiness is attributed to the introduction of new models in fast-growing segments such as SUVs, CNG, and EVs, enabling the companies to maintain their position in the market.",Tata Motors Ltd.
