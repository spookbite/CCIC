"  April 10, 2023 / 06:44 AM IST  ",Ten stocks gear up to deliver up to 15% returns as RBI slams brakes on rate hikes,"The Monetary Policy Committee of the Reserve Bank of India has decided to retain the repo rate at 6.5 percent with a 5:1 majority focussing on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target while supporting growth.The total repo rate hike by the RBI since May 2022 was 250 basis points with the objective of bringing inflation down to its target of 4 percent (+/- 2 percent).Some experts expected one last rate hike of 25 bps, while others had forecast a long pause to assess the impact of earlier rate hikes on growth.“This is in line with our expectations and possibly a best-case scenario and positive for the markets. The RBI has remained prudent as it evaluates the comprehensive effect of rate hikes that we saw over the last year,” said Divam Sharma, founder of Green Portfolio PMS.Food inflation is a matter of grave concern for the RBI and it is willing to bend over backwards to slow inflation and get it back to the tolerance band, he said.The RBI raised its growth forecast to 6.5 percent from 6.4 percent earlier, while the inflation forecast for the current financial year was lowered to 5.2 percent from 5.3 percent earlier, assuming an annual average crude oil price (Indian basket) of $85 per barrel and a normal monsoon.But it feels the lag in the passthrough of input costs could keep core inflation elevated. Inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index was 6.44 percent in February compared with 6.52 percent in the previous month.Anil Rego, founder of Right Horizons PMS, said the unchanged stance signals that the RBI is confident of its projections and expects inflation to cool gradually.Hence, Divam said there will be some respite for large debt companies, growth stocks, small and mid-cap space companies, and specific sectors like consumer durables and real estate in the medium term, thanks to the RBI’s decision to not hike rates.The benchmark stock indices extended their upward journey for the fifth consecutive session amid volatility, with the BSE Sensex rising almost 52 points to 59,741 levels and the Nifty 50 climbing 19 points to 17,576 levels, at 14:01 hours IST.Here is a list of rate-sensitive stocks that experts said can return up to 15 percent in the short term.

"  April 10, 2023 / 06:25 AM IST  ","Interview | Cement, infra likely to outperform broader markets in coming weeks, says this technical chartist","In the coming weeks, 'we expect cement and infra sectors to outperform which have not felt the heat in the recent correction. UltraTech Cement, Shree Cement and L&T are our preferred picks,' Arun Kumar Mantri, the proprietor of Mantri Finmart says in an interview with Moneycontrol.Apart from these two sectors, he feels some financial counters like Cholamandalam Investment and Finance, HDFC, and Bajaj Finance can also do well as early signs of positive reversal are already seen on the weekly charts.The SEBI Registered Investment Advisor with over 11 years of experience in the industry says the rise in Minda Corporation and Anurag Rasayan was accompanied by massive delivery volumes indicating the entry of strong hands in both counters and they may outperform the broader markets in the coming weeks as well.Will the Nifty find it difficult to surpass its record highs hit in December last year?Nifty has been in the timewise correction for the past few months and has given a strong reversal from the key support area in the last few days which is the first sign of strong base formation around the 16,700-16,800 levels. We expect market to hit fresh highs in the current calendar year itself as major of negatives are already factored in the price.Among the technical levels, 17,800-18,100 will be the near-term hurdles and above that new highs can be expected in the next couple of quarters.Considering the recent rebound, do you think the Bank Nifty will not break its 200-day EMA, at least in April?Bank Nifty has been the major culprit behind the recent carnage in the Indian markets. It is still underperforming in the current calendar year where it generated a negative return of over 4.5 percent, whereas Nifty made negative return of 2.8 percent.We expect Bank Nifty to do well in the current month as per the weekly chart set up and 39,800-40,000 will act as good support zones which also coincide with its 200-day EMA. The banking and Financial sector can outperform in the near term and Bank Nifty is expected to defend 40,000 levels in the current series for the targets of 42,000-42,200 levels.What is your take on Minda Corporation and Anupam Rasayan India which rallied 26 percent each in the last three weeks?Minda Corporation and Anupam Rasayan have been under tremendous momentum from past few weeks. Interestingly, the rise in the price was accompanied with massive delivery volumes indicating entry of strong hands in both the counters and may outperform the broader markets in the coming weeks as well.Minda Corporation has minor hurdle near Rs 255-260 zone above which fresh new highs can be tested. On the other hand, Anupam Rasayan has surpassed major resistance zones on the daily charts and is all set to enter the four-digit figure and may conquer Rs 1,100 plus levels.Is the more steam left in the Nifty Realty index that has seen a consistent run-up in the last five days after forming a Bullish Engulfing pattern and taking support at June 2022 lows?Nifty Realty Index gave an excellent reversal from the recent lows of 370 odd levels and made more than 6 percent return in the last couple of weeks. But on the weekly charts, the price is nearing stiff resistance area of 415-420 levels and surpassing the same will be the acid test.In the longer-term picture, the index seems to be still in a range and expected to trade within the same and no further positive action is expected in the near term. The support for the index is around 375-380 and is expected to consolidate with some stock-specific action to remain in focus.Which are the most attractive sectors/stocks that can see a healthy run up in the rest of April?In the coming weeks, we expect the cement and infra sectors to outperform which has not felt the heat in the recent correction. UltraTech Cement, Shree Cement and L&T are our preferred picks. Apart from these two sectors, some financial counters like Cholamandalam Investment and Finance, HDFC and Bajaj Finance can also do well as early signs of positive reversal is already seen on the weekly charts.In your trading strategy on sector or stock, do you give the most importance to ..... (in terms of chart patterns, indicators, Options strategy)?Technical Analysis is more kind of art rather than science where price and volume are the only two major ingredients to analyse the relative action in any counter or index. Among the indicators, we extensively use Bollinger Bands and RSI together to evaluate volatility and major trigger levels.On the derivative front, we track open interest of Nifty and its stocks along with their relative VIX and Put Call ratios to decide the overbought or oversold zones for the short-term perspective.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.
