"  June 21, 2023 / 06:43 AM IST  ","Trade Spotilght | How to trade in Shriram Finance, Balkrishna Industries, Dr Lal Path Labs","The last hour of buying helped the benchmark indices sustain their upward journey for the second consecutive session and, as a result, both the indices moved closer to record high levels on June 20. We saw an uptrend in most key sectors.The BSE Sensex rose 159 points to 63,328, and the Nifty50 advanced 61 points to 18,817, while the broader markets stayed strong with the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices rising half a percent each.Bank Nifty also showed similar trend like Nifty50, rising 133 points to 43,767, while India VIX, which measures the expected volatility for the next 30 days in the Nifty50, fell by 0.82 percent from 11.23 to 11.13 levels, giving comfort to bulls.Stocks that were in action on Tuesday included Shriram Finance, Balkrishna Industries, and Dr Lal Path Labs. Shriram Finance rallied over 6 percent to Rs 1,560, the highest closing level since November 25, 2021. The stock has formed robust bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts with above average volumes after breakout of horizontal resistance trendline adjoining multiple resistance points.Balkrishna Industries has also formed strong bullish candlestick pattern on the daily scale with above average volumes as it jumped 4.5 percent to Rs 2,453.5, the highest closing level since May 26. The stock has been sustaining 26-day EMA since April 12, which also acted as a support many a times in last two months.Dr Lal PathLabs has seen healthy volumes in last few sessions. The stock has maintained upward journey for third consecutive session, rising 4.8 percent to Rs 2,223 on Tuesday. In fact, it has given a close above 200-day EMA (exponential moving average - Rs 2,141), which is a positive sign.Here's what Viraj Vyas of Ashika Stock Broking recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:Shriram FinanceThe stock has experienced a significant uptrend from the COVID-19 lows until February 2021. Since then, it has been consolidating within a range of Rs 1,430 to Rs 1,130. Recently, there has been a surge in volume, albeit due to a block deal, followed by sustained buying activity.In case of any dips, the gap area between Rs 1,400 and Rs 1,450 is expected to provide strong support. The stock has a potential target of Rs 1,900 to Rs 2,000.However, considering the recent aggressive move, it may undergo a consolidation phase before further upward movement. As long as the gap area remains intact, buying on dips is recommended.Balkrishna IndustriesThe stock has shown a robust uptrend since March 2020, rallying from Rs 600 to nearly Rs 2,700 levels. On the daily chart, it has successfully broken the pattern of lower highs and lower lows, indicating strength.However, on the weekly chart, a breakout is still awaited. The stock is currently forming an Ascending Triangle pattern, and a breakout above Rs 2,480-2,490 zone is expected to confirm the resumption of the original uptrend.Dr Lal PathLabsDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, this stock emerged as a favourite in the pharma and healthcare sector, experiencing a remarkable rally from Rs 1,180 to Rs 4,200 levels in just 17 months. However, after such a significant move, stocks often undergo price or time corrections, and this stock has witnessed a substantial price correction.Recently, it has found support at Rs 1,800-level and is showing an increase in trading volumes. On the weekly chart, a 'Double Bottom' pattern has formed, and for further momentum, a breakout above Rs 2,600 level is necessary.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

"  June 21, 2023 / 03:41 PM IST  ",Sony says it is taking SEBI's interim order on Zee CEO and MD Punit Goenka seriously,"Sony Pictures Entertainment said on Wednesday it took the Indian markets regulator's order banning Zee Entertainment founder and chief executive officer from holding board positions 'seriously' and will continue to monitor developments that may affect its deal with Zee.This is Sony's first comment post the Securities and Exchange Board of India's (SEBI) ban last week against Zee Group Chairman Subhash Chandra and CEO Punit Goenka for a year, saying they were actively involved in diverting company funds to the group's related entities.“There have been several erroneous press reports recently speculating about the future of Zee’s planned merger with SPNI (Sony Pictures Networks India) following SEBI’s interim order against Subhash Chandra and Punit Goenka. We take very seriously the SEBI interim order and will continue to monitor developments that may affect the deal,” Sony Pictures Entertainment said in a statement on June 21.It was reported that Sony is committed to the merger in its original shape and that nothing has changed for SPNI. While SPNI has a plan for the worst case scenario if Goenka does not get a relief from courts, the company is not having discussions on the matter currently, a news report said.Legal experts note that as Goenka was supposed to be the MD and CEO of the merged entity there could be a scenario where the two companies will have to amend the scheme and propose a new CEO and MD if the SEBI order is not overturned.Chandra and Goenka filed a plea against the SEBI order in the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT), challenging the ban. The matter has been posted for hearing on June 26. Goenka's counsel during the hearing in SAT had asked for a stay on on Sebi's interim order.In its interim order on June 12, SEBI banned Essel Group chairman Subhash Chandra and his son Goenka from holding any directorial or key managerial position for siphoning funds from Zee for their own benefit.Additionally, the National Company Law Tribunal hearing on the Zee-Sony merger matter is also posted for June 26.The ban comes as worries over a potential delay on the merger of Zee Entertainment with the local unit of Japan's Sony Corp have resurfaced.SEBI’s order is likely to further delay the already dragged-out merger, according to a legal expert.",Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd.
"  June 21, 2023 / 07:38 AM IST  ",SAT to review Zee CEO Punit Goenka's plea challenging Sebi order on June 26,"The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) in its June 19 hearing said that it will review Zee Entertainment Enterprises MD and CEO Punit Goenka’s plea on June 26. The plea challenges the interim order issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), which prohibits Goenka from serving as a director or holding a key managerial position in any listed company.The counsel appearing on behalf of Goenka asked for a stay on SEBI's order and said that SEBI has no evidence beyond bank statements to prove allegations of round-tripping of funds, and it cannot pass ex parte order.SEBI took action against Essel Group Chairman Subhash Chandra and Goenka, alleging that promoters misrepresented investors and the regulator about the repayment of Rs 200 crore to ZEEL by seven related parties. It said that the Rs 200 crore repaid to Zee by seven borrowing entities actually originated from Zee and Zee did not receive any funds and the entries were just book entries.Zee's counsel said that the books of Zee were not cooked and these were not just book entries. The counsel also asked for a stay on Sebi's interim order. The counsel further said that the amount was returned back by borrowing entities to ZEEL and the company also informed the same in 2019 through a corporate announcement.The matter had first come up for hearing in SAT on June 15 and the tribunal had asked Sebi to file a reply in the matter before the appellant before 2 pm on June 18.Sebi in an interim order, on June 12, stated that Subhash Chandra and Punit Goenka have allegedly abused their positions for personal financial gain.SEBI alleged that Subhash Chandra and Punit Goenka have engaged in the alienation of assets belonging to Zee Entertainment and other listed companies of the Essel Group, with the aim of benefiting their Associate Entities.The National Company Law Tribunal hearing on the Zee-Sony merger matter is also posted for June 26.",Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd.
