"  March 20, 2023 / 09:27 AM IST  ","Adani Group suspends Rs 34,900-cr petchem project amid Hindenburg fiasco","Adani Group has suspended work on a Rs 34,900 crore petrochemical project at Mundra in Gujarat as it focuses on resources to consolidate operations and address investor concerns following a damning report by a US-based short seller, sources said.The group’s flagship Adani Enterprises Ltd (AEL) had in 2021 incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary, Mundra Petrochem Ltd, for setting up a greenfield coal-to-PVC plant at the Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ) land in the Kutch district of Gujarat.But after Hindenburg Research’s January 24 report alleging accounting fraud, stock manipulations and other corporate governance lapses chopped off about $140 billion from the market value of Gautam Adani’s empire, the apples-to-airport group is hoping to claw back and calm jittery investors and lenders through a comeback strategy.The comeback strategy is based on addressing investor concerns around debt by repaying some loans, consolidating operations, and fighting off allegations.The group has denied all allegations levelled by Hindenburg. As part of this, projects are being re-evaluated based on cash flow and finance available and of the projects, the group has decided not to pursue for the time being is the 1 million tonnes per annum Green PVC project, two sources with knowledge of the matter said.The group has shot off mails to vendors and suppliers to “suspend all activities” on an immediate basis.In the mails, seen by PTI, the group has asked them to “suspend all activities of the scope of work and performance of all obligations” for Mundra Petrochem Ltd’s Green PVC project “till further notice. This is the following “unforeseen scenario”. The management, it said, was “re-evaluating various project/s being implemented at group level in different business verticals. Based on future cash flow and finance, some of the project/s are being re-evaluated for its continuation and revision in the timeline.”Reached for comments, a group spokesperson said AEL will be evaluating the status of growth projects in the primary industry verticals over the coming months.“The balance sheet of each of our independent portfolio companies is very strong. We have industry-leading project development and execution capabilities, strong corporate governance, secure assets, and strong cash flows, and our business plan is fully funded. We remain focused on executing our previously outlined strategy to create value for our stakeholders,” the spokesperson said. “AEL will be evaluating the status of growth projects in the primary industry vertical over the coming months”.Shares of AEL were trading 2.7 percent lower at Rs 1,826.1 on the BSE.Catch up on all LIVE stock market updates hereThe unit was to have a poly-vinyl-chloride (PVC) production capacity of 2,000 KTPA (kilo tonne per annum) requiring 3.1 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of coal that was to be imported from Australia, Russia and other countries.PVC is the world’s third-most widely produced synthetic polymer of plastic. It finds wide applications – from flooring to making sewage pipes and other pipe applications, in insulation on electrical wires, packaging and manufacture of aprons etc.Adani Group had planned the project as PVC demand in India at around 3.5 MTPA was growing at the rate of 7 per cent year-on-year. With near-stagnant domestic production of PVC at 1.4 million tonnes, India is dependent on imports to keep pace with the demand.The Hindenburg report had alleged “brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud” and the use of offshore shell companies to inflate stock prices. The group has denied all Hindenburg allegations, calling them “malicious”, “baseless” and a “calculated attack on India”.As part of the comeback strategy, the group has cancelled a Rs 7,000 crore coal plant purchase as well as shelved plans to bid for a stake in power trader PTC to conserve expenses. It has repaid some debt and pre-paid some of the finances raised by pledging promoter stakes in group companies.",Adani Enterprises Ltd.

"  March 20, 2023 / 06:46 AM IST  ","Hot Stocks | Bet on KPIT Technologies, Godrej Consumer Products for the short-term","The market ended last week in the negative terrain, shedding 1.80 percent from its previous week’s closure with the Nifty settling down at the 17,100 level. Intense sell-off around the world dented the market sentiment and, mirroring which, the Nifty tumbled below the 200 SMA (simple moving average - 17,451).However, the last trading session could be seen as constructive development for the markets as the index revived from the crucial support of 17,000-16,900 zone. On the technical front, we are not entirely out of the woods and the broader trajectory remains tentative, but we may expect some bounce in the near term.As far as levels are concerned, the recent swing low of 16,900-16,850 is likely to act as the sheet anchor’s role, and it is highly anticipated that the dip would augur well for the bulls.On the flip side, 17,200-17,250 is the immediate hurdle, followed by the sturdy wall of 200 SMA placed around 17,400-17,450 odd zone.Going ahead, any relief on the global front could act as the catalyst to provide the much-needed impetus for our market to surge upwards. Hence, we need to keep a close tab on global developments in the coming week.Traders are advised to avoid aggressive bets and look for stock-specific action, while investors could now seize this opportunity by initiating accumulation in good blue-chip companies in a staggered manner.Here are two buy calls for short term:Godrej Consumer Products: Buy | LTP: Rs 947 | Stop-Loss: 905 | Target: Rs 998-1,012 | Return: 7 percentGodrej Consumer Products has seen a strong spurt in the last two trading sessions, backed by notable volumes on the daily chart, signifying positive development in the counter.On a technical aspect, the stock is on the verge of a breakout which is being supported by a positive crossover on the 14-day RSI (relative strength index), adding to the bullish quotient.Hence, we recommend buying Godrej Consumer Products for target of Rs 998-1,012 and keep a stop-loss of Rs 905.KPIT Technologies: Buy | LTP: Rs 869 | Stop-Loss: Rs 820 | Target: Rs 920-940 | Return: 8 percentKPIT Technologies is in a secular uptrend and is hovering in a cycle of higher highs – higher lows, and is currently at its lifetime high. The stock has surged on the back of robust volumes in the past couple of trading sessions, adding to a bullish quotient.The primary indicators align with the trend suggesting a continuation in the movement in a comparable period.Hence, we recommend buying KPIT Technologies with a target of Rs 920-940 and keep a stop-loss of Rs 820.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.
