"  July 28, 2023 / 07:17 PM IST  ","ACC’s stellar Q1 earnings fail to excite D-Street, brokerage ratings vary","Adani group-owned cement maker ACC’s strong performance on key financial metrics in Q1FY24 doesn’t seem to have impressed analysts on Dalal Street. While ACC’s announcement of the quarterly earnings in market hours on Thursday failed to induce a strong upward move on Friday as well, brokerage ratings varied from 'underweight' to 'buy'.The cement makers’ shares traded flat on Friday, having closed at Rs 1,945, up merely 0.23 percent. Intraday, the stock was seen up by 1.74 percent.ACC’s stock has seen a gradual rise from July 21 - having risen by 10.8 percent - but in year-to-date terms, it has declined by 20.28 percent.FinancialsACC on July 27 reported a net profit of Rs 466.1 crore for the June quarter, up by 105 percent from Rs 227 crore reported in Q1FY23.Revenue for Q1FY24 stood at Rs 5,201.1 crore, up by 16.4 percent from Rs 4,468 crore in Q1FY23.The EBITDA (earnings-before-interest-taxes-depreciation and ammortisation) for Q1FY24 jumped by 81 percent YoY to Rs 770.9 crore. Margins for the quarter under review were up by 530 basis points at 14.8 percent on a yearly basis.The sales volume of cement and clinker, primary revenue generators for the company, saw a 23.6 percent rise YoY at 9.4 million tonnes in the June quarter.Increase in sales volume, reduction in fuel costs and improved operational efficiency reportedly aided the company in recording strong numbers for the quarter. ACC expects the EBITDA growth momentum to continue in oncoming quarters, the cement maker said in its commentary on the quarterly results.Brokerage viewsAlthough the cement maker’s quarterly earnings have beaten the market estimates, brokerages differ in terms of their ratings.Factoring in ACC’s savings of Rs 250 per tonne on energy and raw material costs (which according to it is better than its peers) and high volume driven sales, Jefferies sees a 16 percent upside. The foreign brokerage recommends a buy and has set a target price of Rs 2,250.On the other hand, Macquarie and Morgan Stanley have rated the stock 'neutral' and 'underweight', respectively. While Macquarie’s rating is a continuation of its previous stance with the target price set at Rs 1,998 per share, Morgan Stanley expects a 14 percent downside considering weak realisations and a slight sequential decline in ACC’s cash position. Morgan Stanley has set a target price of Rs 1,650 per share.The variance in terms of brokerage ratings extends into the domestic realm as well.Axis securities has recommended a buy at a target price of Rs 2,540, seeing a 31 percent upside from the prevailing price. “We expect the company to report volume growth of 12 percent CAGR over FY23-FY25E, EBITDA/tonne improving to Rs 920 in FY25 and margins to 16 percent,” the brokerage report observed. The brokerage expects operationalisation of the Ametha unit in Q2FY24 to benefit the company.Motilal Oswal Financial Services (MOFS), on the other hand, has given a 'neutral' rating with the target price set at Rs 2,180. MOFS in its report acknowledged the cement maker’s quarterly performance having beaten its expectations. Considering the management’s guidance of sustaining the current cost structure, it expects the EBITDA figures for FY24E/25E to grow by 25%/23%. Noting that there is still a lack of clarity on ACC’s growth plans, the brokerage has decided to continue its stance considering that the stock continues to trade at attractive valuations.Sectoral outlookWhile the financial services firms and brokerages differ in their ratings, there is consensus in their demand outlook for the cements sector.Foreign as well as the domestic brokerages expect the strong demand trend to continue considering the demand from the housing segment and an increased spending on infra-projects by the government ahead of general elections.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

The margin miss was primarily due to an adverse mix of lower-end motorcycles and a lower 3W mix. Management indicated that although retail demand in key export markets is likely to have bottomed out, the lack of availability of USD for trade remains the major factor hampering export visibility. The domestic motorcycle industry continues to see weak demand and management is now guiding for 4-6% volume growth over the next few months, largely driven by the 125cc and above segments.

"  July 28, 2023 / 10:14 AM IST  ",Mixed views from brokerage firms on BPCL following Q1 results,"Brokerage firms have mixed views on Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd post its June quarter results and earnings call.Jefferies India has downgraded the stock to hold from buy and lowered its target price to Rs 425 from Rs 445 a share. Kotak Institutional Equities and Motilal Oswal Securities have retained their reduce and neutral call on the stock, respectively.Meanwhile, ICICI Securities and Nomura Research have maintained their Buy ratings on BPCL and increased their target prices. ICICI Securities expects a target price of Rs 540 a share from Rs 445 a share while Nomura expects a 20 percent increase in stock price to Rs 455 a share from Rs 379 earlier.BPCL has delivered earnings that surpassed expectations, primarily driven by substantial over-recoveries in retail fuel marketing and improved refining margins, which can be attributed to the advantages gained from discounted Russian crude.Kotak and Jefferies expect that there has been a recent decline in earnings momentum due to a reduced discount on Russian crude impacting refining, and the increasing oil prices affecting marketing. As profits return to a normal state, there will be a significant rise in net debt starting from FY25E, coupled with a 2-3x increase in capex compared to previous levels.According to Kotak's perspective, a significant portion of the losses incurred last year has been regained, which raises the possibility of a retail fuel price reduction. Despite the improvement in debt-related concerns, Kotak's main worry for oil marketing companies (OMCs) lies in their lack of pricing freedom.Meanwhile, Nomura expects the refining outlook remains robust, underpinned by a strong 2.2mn b/d YoY increase in global oil demand, strong demand anticipated for China, driven by an uptick in air travel and petchem,  a favourable supply-demand scenario and significant drawdown in global product inventories.""We sharply raise our FY24F EBITDA by 81% on factoring in BPCL’s robust performance in 1QFY24 and broadly retain FY25F EBITDA. We factor conservative estimates across refining and marketing margins and reiterate Buy given a robust refining outlook. The stock trades at 1.2x FY25F P/B"", Nomura's latest report said to its investors.Going forward, ICICI Securities anticipates a normalization of marketing margins and softer gross refining margins (GRMs) throughout the remainder of FY24E. Despite adopting conservative assumptions for both segments, FY24E earnings are projected to exceed current street estimates by a significant margin of 17 percent to 27 percent. The brokerage house revised FY24E/25E EPS by 15.5 percent/22.9 percent respectively.""Even as GRM assumptions are 54 percent lower vs FY23 levels and ~INR 4/ltr for retail fuels (vs INR 8.8/ltr for Q1), we expect a peer-leading 113 percent EPS CAGR for BPCL (consolidated) over FY23-FY25E (albeit helped by the 69 percent fall in EPS in FY23). Revival of progress at the Mozambique mega project is an additional value driver. At our revised estimates, valuations of just 5.3x EPS / 5.1x EV/EBITDA (based on FY25E) are unchallenging"", said ICICI Securities in a note to investors.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

"  July 28, 2023 / 10:05 AM IST  ",Canara Bank: Can this Jhunjhunwala bet beat its industry peers?,"Two years ago, the late ace investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala increased his stake in Canara Bank  after stating that PSB stocks are “horribly undervalued,” and his spouse Rekha Jhunjhunwala has stuck with the bet since then. In fact, she increased her holdings of the public sector bank this year and her stake in the bank was 2.07 percent as of June end.Jhunjhunwala’s conviction is shared by many, and investors have grown fond of public sector bank shares in general over the past one year. That explains the massive outperformance of the Nifty PSU Bank index vis-à-vis the broader Nifty 50. The banking index has galloped 64 percent in the past one year against Nifty’s 19 percent. Even in the past month, public sector bank shares have been investors’ bargain-hunting ground.Canara Bank’s share price has gained 50 percent in the past year, but it hasn’t been able to outpace its peers. It still trades below its one-year forward book value and analysts do not expect any change or re-rating here. Canara Bank has not received the same treatment as the largest lender, State Bank of India (SBI), or Bank of Baroda that trade slightly above or at their one-year forward book value and are the top public sector bank picks of several brokerages.Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities and JM Financial have put the fair value of the stock at 0.8 times estimated one-year forward book value while those at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd have assigned a fair value at 0.9 times.But Canara Bank’s chief is making all the right noises about risk and growth that would be music to the ears of investors.  The rerating odds have also increased.Underwriting right risksBankers have warned that instances of mispricing of risk have been found in corporate loans amid a rise in private capex and the rush to lend to large companies.Canara Bank’s Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, K Satyanarayana Raju, wants to be measured and cautious in lending. “We are not keen on competing with other banks for topline growth,” he told Moneycontrol in an interview. “We would not lend at throwaway prices.”Also read:MC Interview: Canara Bank is focused on CASA growth, says MD RajuThis is a departure from the typical trend of wholesale bankers which indicated growth as the top priority. The fallout of the approach has been a punishing bad loan cycle. Raju expressed caution not just on corporate lending but also the unsecured personal loan space that has had banks fight it out for market share. “We are sanctioning personal loans only to existing customers and only to those that have salaried accounts with us. We don’t want to go too aggressively here,” Raju told reporters in his interaction post quarterly results on July 24.Analysts believe that the bank has enough levers in place for growth and enough provisioning against risks. JM Financial is expecting credit costs to be contained at 120 basis points (bps) in the FY24-FY25 period. The lender reported credit costs of 110 bps for Q1FY24. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.Hits and misses in Q1 Canara Bank’s strength was its asset quality in the first quarter which helped it report the highest ever quarterly net profit. The pile of delinquencies has dropped steadily and fell 16.4 percent year-on-year in April-June of FY24. What’s more is that loans that show early stress, known as special mention accounts (SMA), also reduced, indicating that the bank has improved its risk underwriting. At the end of June, bad loans were 5.15 percent of the lender’s loan book, down from 6.98 percent a year ago. The upshot is that return on equity and return on assets have improved and analysts believe there will be more improvement in the coming quarters. “The healthy trend on bad debt recoveries is likely to continue for some more time given the large bad asset pool carried by the bank. Along with this, a high financial leverage will ensure the bank delivers mid-to-high teen RoEs over the medium term,” analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities wrote in their note.Also read:Canara Bank Q1 results | Net profit rises 74.8% to Rs 3,535 croreBut the bank fared poorly when it came to deposits and loan growth was lower than peers that have declared results so far. Its advances grew 13 percent year-on-year and deposits huffed and puffed at a mere 6 percent. Raju says the lender has several measures in mind to boost deposit growth, especially low-cost current and savings account (CASA). The bank is targeting an increase in the share of CASA in overall deposits to 35 percent by end of FY24 from the current 33 percent. “During the rest of the year, we will be introducing (CASA) products specifically for women and also products for pensioners,” he told Moneycontrol.Even so, Canara Bank’s CASA ratio doesn’t match up to its peers such as Punjab National Bank (42 percent for Q1), Bank of Baroda, and even Bank of India. This increases the pressure on its margins in the coming quarters compared to others. With 80 percent of repricing of corporate loans complete, the lender has little room to boost yields. That said 52 percent of its loan book is priced off MCLR (marginal cost-based lending rate) which gives it flexibility to increase lending rates.The trajectory of its margins in the coming quarters would be one of the main contributors to a rethink on its valuation by analysts. Also, investors would wait for proof on the bank’s claim of superior risk underwriting through asset quality metrics. For FY24, though, Canara Bank has all the ingredients for further upside.",Canara Bank

He said that it will have access to all the goodwill, brand assets and so on for its growth and success.The 40 percent holding was also to give some headroom for growth by bringing in some strategic investors. Later in the interaction, in answer to an analyst’s query, he said that he did not imply that there is an intention (for ITC) to exit (ITC Hotels) completely. It is “never to completely move out of it”, he said.For ITC investors’ exitOn whether the company will have any arrangement to help investors of ITC get an exit, Puri said that each investor will need to take an independent decision. “We have no arrangement with anyone (to facilitate this),” he said.“Tourism industry is in good shape and the (investor) interest in this (the new company) will be equal (to that in ITC) if not more… anybody who does not wish to be with it (ITC Hotels), market dynamics will give an exit. We won’t participate in that,” he said.On ITC Hotels’ balance sheetIn saying that ITC Hotels has access to a strong balance sheet, the senior executive said that he did not mean that the company can access ITC’s balance sheet. “It is that ITC Hotels has a strong balance sheet, starting out with Rs 6,000 crore in net assets and with no debt,” he said. With this the company can go to the market and leverage its balance sheet to raise capital, over and above the cash flows it generates, he added.On ITC’s EIH Limited holdingsPuri said that he cannot go line by line on the investments but said that all operating investments will move to the new entity.On asset-right strategyTo questions from analysts on whether the new entity will have a more aggressive asset-acquisitions strategy, Puri replied in the negative. He said that the new entity too will continue to have the asset-right strategy (not asset-zero or asset-light strategies) which is based on management contracts. “If a trophy property comes up, then the board will decide at that point,” he added.",ITC Ltd.

"  July 28, 2023 / 11:58 AM IST  ",IOCL gains ahead of June quarter earnings,"Shares of Indian Oil Corp Ltd (IOCL) gained a percent ahead of its June quarter earnings due later on July 28, with state-run oil marketer expected to post a strong set of numbers driven by a sharp recovery in margins.According to a Bloomberg poll of two brokerages, IOCL will report a profit of Rs 7,576.10 crore. Revenue is expected to be around Rs 1.91 trillion, according to six brokerages, while two brokerages peg the EBITDA at Rs 20,698.80 crore.Analysts expect IOCL to report improved operational performance due to a recovery in marketing gains with blended margins reaching Rs 9 a litre, up from Rs 3 a litre in the previous quarter. This improvement is expected despite lower Gross Refining Margins (GRMs).  Analysts estimate refining margins of $10.1 /bbl for IOCL in comparison to $15.2/bbl in 4QFY23.The Benchmark Singapore margins declined to $4.1 a barrel from $8.2 in Q4FY23, primarily because of a significant drop in diesel and ATF spreads by approximately $12.This reduction in refining spreads will be partially offset by the ongoing procurement of discounted Russian crude. As a result, though refining profits are expected to be lower, the recovery in marketing margins is likely to drive the Q1 profits after tax, analysts said.Follow our live blog for all the market action""We anticipate IOCL's EBITDA to rise 11x YoY (up 7 percent QoQ) attributable to strong marketing offset by weak refining. Marketing margins have risen sharply over the past two quarters amid falling crude prices,” Nuvama Research said in a note to investors.Diesel marketing margins are estimated at Rs 10 a litre (INR-15 YoY, INR+2 QoQ). It expects a 5 percent year on year rise in domestic retail sales this quarter, the note said.“We expect throughput to decline 2 percent YoY and QoQ. Singapore GRMs have plunged 80 percent YoY and 50 percent  QoQ. Petchem is likely to remain subdued on weak realisation YoY"", it said.Analysts said the high auto fuel over-recoveries are expected to offset the substantial decline in refining margins during Q1FY24, which is estimated to be over 50 percent lower at approximately $4.1 a barrel.Despite a sequential decline in IOCLs' GRM, they are projected to continue outperforming the Singapore complex GRM due to the advantage of utilizing discounted Russian crude oil.At 10.50 am, the stock was trading at Rs 96.55 on the BSE, up a percent from its previous close.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

"  July 29, 2023 / 07:03 AM IST  ",L&T buyback: Will it continue to propel the stock higher?,"India's biggest engineering company, Larsen & Toubro (L&T), plans to give back extra money to its shareholders by repurchasing up to Rs 10,000 crore worth of shares through a buyback.The engineering conglomerate’s board has approved the proposal to buy back 3.33 crore shares, representing 2.4 percent of the total paid-up equity share capital, at a tentative price of Rs 3,000 per share, which is the maximum being considered by L&T at the moment. The offer represents an over-17 percent premium to the July 25 closing price of Rs 2,561.95.Once the shareholder's approval for the buyback is received, L&T will decide on a date and the final price, the infrastructure giant’s Chief Financial Officer R Shankar Raman said in a post-earnings conference call with the media.Boost returns?The buyback is part of L&T's plan to improve its Return on Equity (RoE) as part of the group's 'Lakshya 2026' plan, Raman added.According to an analyst from a foreign brokerage firm, the buyback is expected to boost L&T's Earnings per share (EPS) and Return on Equity (RoE). The analyst foresees a potential enhancement of RoE by 40-60 basis points (bps), while EPS could see a slight upward revision of merely 4-5 percent.When a company buys back its own stock, it reduces the number of outstanding shares. As a result, the company's earnings are divided among fewer shares, which automatically increases its EPS. The return on equity would also improve because there is less outstanding equity.“This (buyback) will likely help the company achieve its strategic target of 18 percent RoE by FY25-26,” said ICICI Securities.Even Nuvama Institutional Equities believes the buyback is a positive surprise.The conglomerate’s decision indicates its confidence in the future growth, and the perception that its stock is undervalued, pointed out Sonam Srivastava, Founder and Fund Manager at Wright Research.“This may buoy the stock price in the short-term, but in the long-term its performance will be dictated by its capital allocation policy. If the company is able to deploy capital to drive higher growth and better quality of earnings, the stock will see good compounded growth,” she said.As on June 30, 2023, L&T's cash-on-books stood at around Rs 40,000-45,000 crore on a consolidated basis.Brokerage commentaryThe buyback has largely been factored in the stock price. What would now carry the stock higher or make it ripe for re-rating is the divestment of non-core assets such as the Hyderabad Metro or Nabha Power.Kotak Institutional Equities is of the view that L&T’s stock is expensive given its 28 times and 23 times its one- and two-year forward earnings.However, Prabhudas Lilladher is optimistic about the engineering major's prospects. It believes L&T is well-placed to benefit in the long term due to several factors, including strong tender opportunities, improved domestic order conversion, a notable increase in hydrocarbon and renewable energy orders from international markets like Saudi Arabia, and an anticipated rise in private investment in the domestic market.The EPC major registered an order inflow of Rs 65,500 crore, up 57 percent year-on-year (YoY) in Q1 FY24, taking the order book as of June-end 2023 to an all-time high of Rs 4.1 trillion, which is around 2.3 times its FY22-23 revenue. The domestic market accounts for 71 percent of this, the rest being international business.Management commentaryThe management has maintained sales growth guidance of 12-15 percent and an order inflow growth target of 10-12 percent.Raman had said during the conference call that L&T is likely to meet the higher end of its revenue and order inflow guidance for 2023-24, and may consider revising its guidance for both revenue and operating margin after the October-December 2023 quarter.He said that L&T's order inflow is likely to taper towards the second half of 2023-24 due to the upcoming general election in India between April and May 2024.""We will have to be wary of a slowdown in order inflow due to the upcoming general election and plans of the subsequent government that may take over,"" Raman said.",Larsen & Toubro Ltd.

On the weekly charts, the stock has been consistently forming Higher Top Higher Bottom pattern since April 2023. However, in the previous week, the Nifty formed long upper wick candle indicating profit booking has happened at higher levels.We witnessed the lower top lower bottom formation in the Nifty Index on the daily charts for the last few days indicating a short term corrective sign.The momentum indicator RSI is declining from over bought level on the daily charts, indicating a loosing positive momentum of the Index for the short term. The index has a strong support at 19,562 (weekly low) followed by 19,230 (key support). While on the higher side, the mark of 19,991 (life high) followed by 20,200 (key resistance) are crucial levels to watch out for.The overall trend of the Nifty index looks positive till it sustains above 19,562 levels and potential upside would be 19,991 followed by 20,200 mark, however if it breaches 19,562 level on the downside then it will correct till 19,230 mark for the short to medium term.Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks:Larsen & Toubro: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,660 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,550 | Target: Rs 2,900 | Return: 9 percentThe correction in the stock of L&T took place gracefully as the stock post December 2022 did not get into the formation of Lower Highs and Lower Lows despite the overall market correction. This illustrates the positive undertone of the prices.Currently, the stock appears to be emerging from a consolidation phase, signaling a continuation of the uptrend. The breakout from this consolidation was accompanied by a Gap and substantial trading volumes, providing further confirmation of the breakout.Moreover, the prices have consistently found support at the 12-day exponential moving average (EMA), which has acted as a reliable variable support level. This reinforces the notion of an upward trend beginning to take shape.The momentum oscillator, MACD (moving average convergence divergence), has demonstrated a favourable crossover above the zero line, reflecting the likelihood of prices trending upward from their current levels.Going forward, we can expect the stock prices to move higher till the level of Rs 2,900 where the stop-loss must be Rs 2,550 on the Daily Closing basis.Escorts Kubota: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,449.35 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,320 | Target: Rs 2,650 | Return: 8 percentThe stock is currently performing at an unprecedented level, with a clear upward trajectory marked by consistent increases in both highs and lows within the established rising channel.Recently, a breakout from a Rounding Bottom pattern was noticed in the stock. This is an encouraging signal that suggests the continuation of the upward trend.When it comes to support levels, the stock prices have been reliably cushioned by the 12 & 26-day exponential moving averages (EMA), reinforcing the upward trend during each phase of growth.As for the momentum of the stock, the MACD indicator remains in a strong position well above the baseline, demonstrating the stock's sustained positive momentum.Looking forward, we anticipate that the stock prices will continue to climb until they reach the level of Rs 2,650. At this point, a stop-loss should be implemented at Rs 2,320 on a closing basis.Godrej Properties: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,707 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,610 | Target: Rs 1,950 | Return: 14 percentThe stock formed CIP (change in polarity) formation near Rs 1,000 levels in March 2023 and bounced back with the formation of Higher Top Higher Bottom on the monthly charts indicating strong positive undertone for the long term trend.On the weekly charts, the stock has given a Cup & Handle pattern breakout with volume confirmation which confirms the bullish structure of the stock. On the daily charts, the stock has been consistently moving upward with the support of 13-day EMA and sustaining at 52-week high level.Also the stock is sustaining above its important moving averages like 50, 100 & 200-day SMA (simple moving average) which shows the strong bullish sentiments of the stock.The momentum indicator RSI (relative strength index) on the weekly as well as on the daily timeframe is rising and sustaining above 65 levels reflecting presence of positive momentum.We expect the prices to move higher till Rs 1,950 level where the stop-loss must be Rs 1,610 strictly on the closing basis.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

The EBITDA margin reported in Q1 was also historically the lowest on a quarterly basis for the drug maker.At 09.22 am, shares of Laurus Labs were trading one percent lower at Rs 340.55 on the NSE.Follow our live blog for all the market actionWhat analysts are sayingMoreover, the management also retained its sales outlook for FY24 as it expects revenue expansion of base pipeline projects and 2H Animal health contract supplies kick-off in the CDMO (Contract Development and Manufacturing Organisation) business.  However, that did little for brokerages to consider it as a positive trigger for the upcoming quarters.Foreign brokerage Jefferies noted that tepid growth in the base business along with the absence of any major CDMO product should result in persisting margin pressure for the drug maker.Alongside, the brokerage also slashed its FY24-26 EPS estimate for Laurus Labs by 12-24 percent. Jefferies has an 'underperform' call on Laurus Labs, with a price target of Rs 250, which reflects a downside potential of over 27 percent from Thursday's closing price.Also Read: Laurus Labs Q1 results: Net profit tanks 88.8% to Rs 28.4 croreMargin erosionA similar bearishness was seen by InCred Equities as it cut its price target for the stock to Rs 294 to price in a downside potential of 14.5 percent from Thursday's closing level. The brokerage also retained its 'reduce' rating on the drug makers, largely on the back of a sharp margin erosion on a year-on-year as well as sequential basis. The firm also believes the current valuations of the stock are expensive, hinting that it will further cap its upside.Choice Broking also sees the drugmaker's Q1 earnings as an indication of a subdued performance through FY24. Additionally, the broking firm believes it will take immense effort from the company to come close to its FY23 performance from the current run rate. ""Further, the ongoing capital expenditure of Rs 1,000 crore will further make it difficult for Laurus Labs to generate a free cash flow in FY24,"" the broking firm mentioned in its report. Choice Broking also has a 'neutral' stance on Laurus Labs, with a price target of Rs 328.Aligned with the trend, Motilal Oswal Financial Services also cut its earnings estimate by 6 percent/3 percent for FY24/FY25 factoring in the adverse impact on Non-ARV (antiretroviral) API (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients) business, a gradual pick-up in the formulation business, and higher operational costs.However, marking a stark contrast from the consensus, MOFSL retained its 'buy' call on the stock, with a rather bullish target price of Rs 410. The firm attributed significant progress across different aspects within the CDMO segment, the limited scope of price pressure in the ARV segment, and adding customers/new products in the Non-ARV API/Formulation segment as reasons behind the positive outlook for Laurus Labs.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

The margin was impacted by certain oneoffs pertaining to provision towards client-specific situations (-200bps impact).OutlookWe downgrade TECHM to Reduce (ADD earlier) with a TP at INR 1,020 (14x Jun-25E EPS) as recovery in growth/margin may be protracted on sub-par bookings and near-term challenges in CME vertical may persist for longer (recent instances of deals from large customers going to competition as well as business challenges for telcos).For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

"  July 29, 2023 / 08:09 PM IST  ",Buy Tech Mahindra; target of Rs 1200: Emkay Global Financial,"Emkay Global Financial's research report on Tech MahindraTechM’s revenue slumped 4% QoQ (4.2% CC) to USD1.6bn, missing our estimates. EBITM declined by 440bps QoQ to 6.8%, well below our estimate even after adjusting for one-offs. The sharp decline in CME (-9.4% QoQ), owing to cut in discretionary spending and closure of network services projects, largely explains the revenue miss. Deal wins remain weak, and stand at USD359mn (TTM deal-intake down ~25% YoY). Mgmt attributed the weak performance to cut in discretionary spend/delay in decision making amid macro uncertainties. It expects performance to recover in H2. We cut FY24E EPS by ~17%, factoring-in a weak Q1 and near-term uncertainty, while lowering FY25- 26E EPS by <2%, in anticipation of demand improvement/better execution. TechM has failed to capitalize on its strength in the areas of communications, ER&D, BPO, XDS, etc, and deliver consistent performance in the past.OutlookWe believe leadership change gives more credence to turnaround efforts, entailing better execution, sustainable margin expansion and scaling of BFSI & other verticals (ex-CME). We retain BUY; TP: Rs1,200, at 16x Jun-25E EPS.For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

"  July 30, 2023 / 08:23 AM IST  ","Tech biggies fail to charm, foreign institutions pull out $2.12 bn amid demand slump","Foreign inflows have had a big role in the Indian market’s recent record-breaking sprint but they cut stake in the big information technology players in the June quarter, the latest shareholding patterns show, as the IT sector grapples with global economic uncertainty.Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) reduced their stake in Infosys, India's second-largest software services firm, to 33.43 percent in the June quarter from 35.08 percent in the previous quarter. This marks the second consecutive quarter that FIIs reduced stake in the Bengaluru-based company.Sharing its June quarter earnings, Infosys slashed its revenue guidance for FY24 to 1-3.5 percent from 4-7 percent amid a challenging demand environment.FII holdings in Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), the country's largest software exporter, fell to 12.46 percent in the June quarter from 12.72 percent, the eleventh consecutive quarter of sell-offs by foreign investors.Tech Mahindra Ltd also experienced a reduction in FII holding by over 100 basis points, bringing it down to 25.69 percent from 26.87 percent in the previous quarter. This is the tenth straight quarter of foreign investors trimming stake in Tech Mahindra.Tech Mahindra’s June quarter net profit declined 38 percent to Rs 692 crore in the June quarter, which CEO CP Gurnani said was one of the toughest quarters in the last five years.One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.Read: Royalty-like arrangement for ITC Hotels to use ITC brands: Sanjiv Puri on demergerOther IT firms like Coforge Ltd, L&T Technology Services Ltd, LTIMindtree Ltd, Mphasis Ltd, Affle India, Birlasoft Ltd and Persistent Systems Ltd  also witnessed selling by foreign investors during the June quarter.For Persistent Systems Ltd, L&T Technology Services Ltd, and LTIMindtree it was second quarter in a row of FII selling, while Mphasis Ltd saw FII outflows for the third consecutive quarter.Bucking the trendWipro Ltd and HCL Technology, however, bucked the trend as they reported a spurt in foreign funds flow. FII raised stake in HCL Tech for the third successive quarter and Wipro the second consecutive quarter.Other midcap IT firms that also saw FII buying are Cyient Ltd, KPIT Technologies Ltd, Zensar Technologies Ltd, Sonata Software Ltd and Tata Elxsi Ltd.Read: NSE Q1 profit up 9% at Rs 1,844 crore, contributes Rs 7,889 crore to the exchequerDemand worriesThe selling by foreign institutional investors (FII's) can be attributed to the weak earnings reported by many IT firms in both March and June quarters.These companies also provided guidance for the upcoming quarters that were below market expectations. The divestment by FIIs shows a lack of confidence in the near-term outlook for these IT companies, according to analysts.Indian IT firms are under pressure as analysts predict a global slowdown, which will likely hit IT spending in the US and Europe. Given that these regions contribute around 40 percent to Indian IT firms' revenues, there are concerns about the adverse effects on the companies' performance.FIIs have withdrawn around $2.12 billion from the IT sector so far in 2023, Kotak Institutional data shows. They remained net sellers in 2022 and 2021, selling stocks worth around $9.27 billion and $3.23 billion, respectively.Despite this pressure, mutual funds increased stakes in some midcap IT companies such as Coforge Ltd, CE Info Systems Ltd, Affle India Ltd, Zensar Technologies Ltd, Birlasoft Ltd, Persistent Systems Ltd, Tata Elxsi.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.
