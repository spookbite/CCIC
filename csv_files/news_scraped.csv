While 1QFY24 is weak due to pre-buying ahead of BS-6 Phase-2 norms, AL expects a strong recovery in volumes from Jul’23. This is based on strong feedback from its customers, who have a good order pipeline. AL expects the ongoing healthy CV cycle to extend, considering favorable underlying macros and a positive outlook for the key end industries. The average age of M&HCVs has increased to 10 years (normal average of 7.5-8 years), which should augur well for replacement demand. AL is starting to see some recovery in replacement demand. In the total M&HCV population of 5.2m units, over 1.1m vehicles are more than 15 years old. While currently there are no major benefits of voluntary scrappage policy (w.e.f Apr’23), strict enforcement by the government would be key for the success of this policy.

"  June 16, 2023 / 09:18 AM IST  ",Analysts see nearly 14% upside in Ashok Leyland; here's why,"Ashok Leyland is likely to be in focus on June 16 morning, a day after an investors’ meeting saw most analysts raise the target price for the stock as they remain bullish on the automotive company.The stock has gained nearly 10 percent this year, while advancing nearly 17 percent since March 28 when the rally started in the market. Benchmark indices the Sensex and the Nifty have gained 3.5 percent during the period year and nearly 10 percent in the past three months.Morgan Stanley has an “overweight” rating and a target price at Rs 178 a share, a 13 percent upside from the current market price. JP Morgan, too, has stuck with an “overweight” call, with a target price at Rs 175.Motilal Oswal has a “buy” rating and expects the stock to rise up to 14 percent from the current market price to Rs 180 a share. JM Finance and Nuvama have the same call and target.On June 15, the stock closed at 159.70 on the National Stock Exchange, up  1.49 percent.In high gearDuring its 2023 Investor Meet on June 15, Ashok Leyland said it wanted to achieve profitable growth in the domestic Medium and Heavy Commercial Vehicle (M&HCV) segment, accelerate the expansion of non-M&HCV revenue, and highlighted the upcoming potential for switch mobility (electric vehicles).The Hinduja Group company plans to launch six platforms under switch mobility within the next two years. The management anticipates the positive momentum in the M&HCV sector to persist and aims to increase its market share by 3 percentage points to 35 percent.The company is also looking to enhance its presence in the Light Commercial Vehicle (LCV) segment. It has set a target of achieving a double-digit EBITDA margin in FY24 and expects a mid-teens EBITDA margin in the medium term.Here is what brokerages said after the meeting:Motilal Oswal SecuritiesWith a stable demand environment and favourable factors such as improving pricing power and steady raw material prices, Ashok Leyland is expected to witness robust earnings growth.The company has strategically positioned itself to capitalise on the commercial vehicle (CV) growth cycle, making it an attractive investment choice. Though the valuations, at 17.3x FY25E P/E and 9.3x EV/EBITDA, indicate a mid-cycle recovery, they do not fully reflect Ashok Leyland's focus on diversifying revenue streams and expanding profit pools.The potential to tap into new revenue sources and increase profitability is not fully priced in by the market.Nuvama ResearchAshok Leyland is expected to witness a growth in market share from 18.8 percent in FY23 to 19.3 percent in FY25E. This growth will be facilitated by the company’s expansion of its product portfolio in the small/intermediate CV segment and of its dealership network in regions outside of South India.The research house expects a revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10 percent between FY23 and FY25E, supported by a favourable industry upcycle, market share gains, and improved realisations.The EBITDA CAGR is expected to be higher at 25 percent, benefiting from increased scale and improved net pricing. The company is anticipated to generate an average annual free cash flow (FCF) of over Rs 2,300 crore between FY24 and FY25E, enabling a reduction in net debt-to-equity ratio from 0.1x in FY23 to -0.1x by FY25E.These projections indicate a positive outlook, highlighting the company’s potential for market share expansion, financial growth, and debt reduction.JP MorganAshok Leyland is working on developing its new energy portfolio, which is expected to be ready within the next 24 months. This signifies the company's focus on transitioning to alternate energy vehicles, aligning with the industry's growing demand for sustainable transportation solutions.Its adoption of modular platforms will play a crucial role in accelerating the shift towards alternate energy vehicles.

"  June 17, 2023 / 08:51 AM IST  ",We asked ChatGPT for the best Indian stocks. Here’s what it came up with,"“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”– Arthur C Clarke (1962)In the heady days before the advent of computers, young, wide-eyed traders beginning their careers at some of London’s famed stockbroking establishments were given a large blue book and calculator on their first day at work.But, if the hapless youngsters were caught using the calculator, the blue book would be hurled at them with great force by hardened veteran traders manning the floors.The lesson? Be razor-sharp with numbers, develop the “trader’s instinct” and don’t depend on a puny device if you want to make it big in the business.Alas, these admirable attributes declined the introduction of computerised trading. Suddenly, a computer terminal was able to parse reams of data and execute millions of trades before a stockbroker could even shout ""buy General Electric"".Not just the calculator and blue book, computers made even humans obsolete on the trading floor.A similar, if not bigger, seismic shift may be underway, at least for retail investors, with the rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI).Generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Bard, Dall-E, Midjourney and various others are hogging the limelight with a smorgasbord of innovative applications, inspiring awe and fear in equal measure.Some early adopters and researchers are also using AI platforms to analyse news reports, US Fed announcements and stock exchange filings. The initial results have been more than encouraging.But how does AI perform when it comes to stock-picking in the Indian context? And can investors repose faith this digital black box? We decided to dig deeper.AbracadabraFor the past few weeks, we ran multiple prompts on ChatGPT to find out its top recommendations among Indian stocks. Both the free and paid versions of the OpenAI-developed chatbot were used.Even though its training data is till September 2021, we figured it would be interesting to see what ChatGPT thinks is worth buying on Dalal Street. And of course, it's not as if the Indian corporate landscape has changed dramatically from end-2021.However, direct queries on which stocks one should invest in were invariably brushed aside with this anodyne response:So we decided to get creative with the prompts. In one query, for instance, we asked ChatGPT to imagine it was a world-renowned money manager and at a conference in Mumbai, an audience member posed a question on the best stocks available in India.Another prompt was:Much like a genuine conversationalist, ChatGPT perked up in response and began to spew out names (albeit with the usual disclaimers).It made its preference clear over multiple iterations. Bluechip names like Reliance Industries, TCS, HDFC Bank and Infosys.The paid version of the chatbot, which has been trained on more parameters than the free-to-use option, too preferred to stick with the market leaders.Nothing too adventurous. Just limit your exposure to traditional market leaders like TCS, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank HUL, ITC and others.Often, the answers veered from specifics to platitudinous advice on how to excel at the hazardous art (and science) of stock-picking.Understand the market trends, consider the financial health of the company, assess its management track record and gauge its ability to adapt to changing conditions. Nothing terribly new, right?On follow-up questions on which companies met these criteria, it reverted to its risk-averse stance:In fact, such was ChatGPT’s bias towards the largecap universe that we began to wonder whether it was aware of any midcap or smallcap names in India at all.So, the next queries were limited to smaller companies.Here, however, it was a lot more difficult to get ChatGPT to recommend names, as it kept on listing general factors to consider while picking stocks.Finally, after many attempts, it did offer some choices:Behind the veilLanguage processing AI models are trained on humongous amounts of text data scraped from the internet.ChatGPT-3, for example, was trained on a whopping 570 GB of data, with 300 billion words being fed into its system. Its successor ChatGPT-4 is trained on even more data, though OpenAI has, so far, not revealed the specifics.So when ChatGPT recommends bluechip stocks, does this mean it is just parroting the names most often mentioned in millions of webpages it has crawled?Daniel Lemire, a leading voice on AI and a computer science professor at the Data Science Laboratory of the Université du Québec (TÉLUQ) in Montreal, said it is certainly possible.“ChatGPT has not yet shown an ability to quickly adapt to fast-changing information. It makes sense that it would recommend large corporations that have a track record of profitability, but these recommendations could be misleading and potentially dangerous,” he told Moneycontrol.Lemire, however, added that ChatGPT has shown that large language models (LLMs) have the ability for superior text comprehension.“This means that it can be used to scour large volumes of text (press releases, annual reports, government announcements, etc) and even data (stock prices and so forth) to potentially identify quickly patterns faster than most human beings ever could. There are already software doing such processing (eg, doing sentiment analysis on text) but it has generally been much more superficial,” he noted.Which means the tool can be of enormous importance to the common investor, at least for market research.LLM industry veteran Matt Busigin, who is the co-founder and CTO of Ollie AI and was also an investment advisor in the US, said he uses ChatGPT for household budgeting, corporate budgeting, product management and other tasks.GPT-4 can be deployed for analysis of data releases and, in particular, natural language such as Fed minutes to make much more rapid post-announcement trading decisions.“This definitely had alpha through most of 2022 (I was paying attention to this), but using that as an edge will probably be eroded quickly in 2023, and it will result in less market volatility post-announcement or data-release, as the information will be more efficiently processed by the markets,” Busigin told Moneycontrol.So what is the takeaway from this experiment? Should you use generative AI tools to pick stocks?It is only appropriate that we let ChatGPT answer this one:",HDFC Bank Ltd.
