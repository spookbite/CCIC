"  February 13, 2023 / 12:00 PM IST  ","Interview | Nifty headed to record high? Next few weeks to give a clear direction, says this expert","""Any close above 18,000 on the Nifty50 will be first sign that the uptrend is resuming again. We need to also see participation from broader market which is lacking so far. So next 1 to 2 weeks will provide a lot more clarity if we can inch towards previous all time high levels,"" Ashish Kyal is the Founder of Wavesstrategy.com says in an interview to Moneycontrol.Among stocks, he believes ABB is one of the strongest stocks that one can find. ""We can expect this wave 5 on upside to take prices to Rs 3,600 or even higher levels,"" he says.But on Adani group stocks, the Chartered Market Technician advised that it is best to avoid investment in the group companies as more pain is left and it is still not out of the woods.Do you think the Nifty will find it difficult to climb the previous record high? What is your Elliot Wave theory and charts telling you?The Nifty has been slowly inching higher but is yet to show good momentum. We need it to first give a break above Budget day high of 17,970 followed by psychological level of 18,000. As per Elliott wave and charts, we might still not be out of the woods as we are yet to see faster retracement above these important levels.Any close above 18,000 will be first sign that the uptrend is resuming again. We need to also see participation from broader market which is lacking so far. Majority of the stocks are still trading below their 50-day average and for a healthy rally Midcap and Smallcap stocks need to participate. So next 1 to 2 weeks will provide a lot more clarity if we can inch towards previous all-time high levels.Bank Nifty is also not giving great support to the market. Do you see any kind of major strength coming in the banking index in the coming weeks?Bank Nifty collapsed from 43,000 level made on January 24, 2023 and touched the low of 39,419 on January 30. We are seeing attempt on upside and if Bank Nifty manages to cross above 42,000 level then we can see it taking a leadership role.Participation from Banking stocks is important to take the market higher but rising interest rates globally and in India with reduction in liquidity remains a concern. So we might see consolidation or pressure in February 2023 but eventually from March 2023 this index can pick up steam.Adani Group stocks have been quite volatile for around three weeks now after recent sharp correction? Do you think one should start investing in some of them?Adani group stocks have started correcting much earlier and not only on back of recent news. Adani Enterprises top was made at Rs 4,190 on December 21, 2022. It is only since January 27, 2023 that the downside momentum increased on back of the news. But the stock has been already under pressure since beginning of 2023.After the crash in Adani Enterprises prices touched the low of Rs 1,017 level and from there we have seen retracement of precise 38.2 percent on upside. This upside retracement is only a dead cat bounce or wave 4 pullback and one leg in form of wave 5 is pending on downside that can again take this stock towards Rs 1,380 or lower levels.So, it is best to avoid investment in even the group companies as more pain is left and it is still not out of the woods.Why are you a big fan of Elliott Wave theory?Elliott wave theory is GPS of the market. It is forward looking tool that helps traders and investors to understand the probable future path of market or that of the stock. It is one of the best forecasting technical analysis study that helps you to understand maturity of the trend and if the bigger trends are about to reverse.Many novice traders look at Elliott wave as 100 percent sure shot tool but one needs to understand that it only indicates market mood or collective crowd psychology in terms of probability and one needs to combine this along with Price action.Do you see the rally to continue in PB Fintech for coming sessions, even after the fantastic run up for second straight week?PB Fintech showed a good up move over past few weeks but it has yet to show a clear higher highs and higher lows formation that as per Dow theory confirms reversal from downtrend to up. So we need to see if prices can show break above Rs 600 level which will be first sign for a good upward trend.New age stocks are showing some relief after a long time but we are yet to see a higher low in them which will further provide conviction to bet on the long side.Do you think the charts of ABB India are becoming strong now and the stock can hit Rs 3,500 mark in current year itself?Yes, ABB is one of the strongest stocks that one can find. This stock has found very good support near 61.8 percent retracement level at Rs 2,640 and showed faster retracement above prior leg. This indicates both price and time reversal and we can expect this wave 5 on upside to take prices to Rs 3,600 or even higher levels.Do you think the Nifty Oil & Gas is in the process of bottoming out to get back into strength?Nifty Oil & Gas has corrected nearly 17 percent in less than 2 weeks. We have seen very sharp decline and yet to see any accumulation or bottoming formation. Short term pullback from oversold state is not ruled out but it is better to avoid bottom fishing here and wait for consolidation or pattern to emerge.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

"  February 13, 2023 / 12:30 PM IST  ",Top 10 trading ideas for next 3-4 weeks as Nifty seems ready for a fresh climb,"The market has been trading within the Budget day range of 17,353 to 17,972 for the seventh straight session on February 10 but, with strong support at 17,800 level, the Nifty50 seems to be preparing the ground for an upward move.Hence, there is a possibility that the Nifty may test the psychological 18,000 mark, followed by 18,200 in the coming sessions, with strong support at 17,800-17,650, and also if the index surpasses the downward sloping resistance trendline adjoining highs of December 1, 2022 (record high) and January 24, 2023, then more upward move may be on cards, according to experts.The Nifty50 closed the week on a flat note at 17,856, forming a Doji sort of candle on the weekly scale, indicating indecisiveness among bulls and bears about future market trend.""Now since we are trading around the crucial juncture, the market is awaiting some solid trigger to come off the recent slumber phase. The breakout could happen either side but if we have to predict one, we would certainly like to stay positive,"" Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One, said.He further said that hopefully the contraction of range breaks out higher and the trend deciding level to watch out for would be 18,000. ""This will confirm the completion of the long corrective phase. We can then see some exuberant moves in the market as the sentiments are likely to improve drastically post the breakout,"" Chavan said.On the flipside, the support range is visible around 17,800 - 17,700.Apart from this, the broader market did well towards the latter half of the week as the Nifty Midcap 100 and Midcap 50 indices gained 2 percent each, and the Smallcap 100 index up over 1 percent. ""The way the Nifty Midcap50 index is shaped up, we remain hopeful to see some encouraging moves in the coming week,"" he said.Let's check out the top 10 trading ideas from experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the February 10 closing prices.Expert: Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC SecuritiesMphasis: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,153 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,990 | Target: Rs 2,480 | Return: 15 percentThe attached weekly timeframe chart of this IT stock (Mphasis) indicates a gradual up-move over the last few weeks. The stock price was in an intermediate down trend in the past and has declined as per lower tops and bottoms on the weekly chart. It seems to have formed a bottom reversal around Rs 1,900 level in December and moving up sustainably since then.The previous negative chart pattern is at the verge of turning into bullish formation like higher tops and bottoms. Hence, the stock price is expected to move up in the coming weeks. A sustainable move above Rs 2,200 level could be considered as a decisive upside breakout of the accumulation pattern. Daily 14 period RSI (relative strength index) shows positive indication.Buying can be initiated in Mphasis at CMP (Rs 2,153), add more on dips down to Rs 2,050, wait for the upside target of Rs 2,350 and next Rs 2,480 in the next 3-5 weeks, with a stop-loss at Rs 1,990.ICICI Lombard General Insurance: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,152 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,075 | Target: Rs 1,325 | Return: 15 percentAfter showing weakness within a broader range in the last one month, the stock price showed bottom reversal at the support of Rs 1,100 levels in the last couple of weeks. The weekly candle pattern indicates multiple bottom reversal formation.As per the broader range movement of Rs 1,150-Rs 1,300 levels, the stock price is expected to move up from near the present area of lower range. Daily and weekly 14 period RSI shows positive indication.One may look to buy ICICI Lombard at CMP (Rs 1,152), add more on dips down to Rs 1,105 and wait for the upside targets of Rs 1,240 and next Rs 1,325 in the next 3-5 weeks, with a stop-loss of Rs 1,075.Expert: Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand RathiLaurus Labs: Buy | LTP: Rs 340 | Stop-Loss: Rs 310 | Target: Rs 385 | Return: 13 percentThough Laurus Labs is looking weak at the current juncture, one needs to pay attention to its last two months' fall from Rs 440 to date. Selling volume is not rising with a fall in price which is an anomaly according to volume spread analysis.In another word, volume is not in sync with the price. Also, on a weekly scale bullish AB=CD pattern has formed near its historical support zone of Rs 320-330 along with the weekly MACD (moving average convergence divergence) histogram is losing downward momentum, thus hinting towards some bounce in the coming few weeks.One can buy Laurus Labs only in the range of Rs 333-340 with a stop-loss of Rs 310 and for target of Rs 385.Gujarat Gas: Buy | LTP: Rs 480 | Stop-Loss: Rs 455 | Target: Rs 530 | Return: 10 percentSince the last couple of months, the said counter has corrected almost 18 percent and currently, it has made nice bottom near Rs 450-455. Buying volume is gradually increasing from lower levels thus indicating bullish momentum in the coming few sessions.From the indicator perspective, on a daily scale of MACD histogram and RSI bullish divergence was seen thus confirming the bullish stance in the counter.One can buy in the range of Rs 475-485 with a target of Rs 530 and a stop-loss of Rs 455 on a daily close basis.Samvardhana Motherson International: Buy | LTP: Rs 80.2 | Stop-Loss: Rs 72 | Target: Rs 95 | Return: 18 percentSince the last 3 months, the said counter has been making higher highs and higher lows structure. Recently it broke its previous swing high of Rs 79.45 along with the 6-month-old trendline was broken and currently is sustaining above it thus hinting upside in the counter.Moreover, the said counter has made nice base around 100 and 50-day EMA (exponential moving average) along with decent volume buying has seen from every lower levels which is looking lucrative.On the indicator front, daily DMI (directional movement index) is in bullish mode also it broke its previous swing thus indicating bullishness in the counter.One can buy in small tranches around Rs 79-81 and another around Rs 77-76 (if tested). Target is expected around Rs 95 and stop-loss would be Rs 72 on daily close basis.Expert: Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.comBharat Forge: Buy | LTP: Rs 883 | Stop-Loss: Rs 863 | Target: Rs 920 | Return: 4 percentThe stock has been forming a ‘Higher Top Higher Bottom’ on the weekly chart and is thus in a broader uptrend. In last couple of weeks, prices have consolidated with lower volume which indicates it to be a time-wise correction within an uptrend.Now the RSI Smoothed oscillator has given a positive crossover on the daily chart and hence, we expect the prices to resume the uptrend soon.Hence, short term traders can look for buying opportunities around current market price of Rs 883 for near term targets of Rs 903 and Rs 920.

"  February 13, 2023 / 06:34 AM IST  ","Hot Stocks | Here's why you should bet on Godrej Properties, SRF for short term","After couple of weeks of dramatic moves with respect to Adani saga, things seemed to have come to an equilibrium towards the fag-end of last week. We have certainly weathered the storm and the market has digested most of the pain from the recent fiasco.Now since we are trading around the crucial juncture, the market is awaiting some solid trigger to come of the recent slumber phase. The breakout could happen either side but if we have to predict one, we would certainly like to stay positive. Hopefully, the contraction of range breaks out higher and the trend deciding level to watch out for would be 18,000.This will confirm the completion of a long corrective phase. We can then see some exuberant moves in market as the sentiment is likely to improve drastically after the breakout. On the flipside, the support range is visible around 17,800 - 17,700.We reiterate that if the benchmark has to surpass the 18,000 mark, the heavyweight banking space needs to participate heavily. Last week, banking stocks kept on sulking and hence, we failed to make a move beyond these hurdles. Hopefully it finds its mojo soon and propels the market higher.Here are two buy calls for short term:SRF: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,289.4 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,230 | Target: Rs 2,370 | Return: 3 percentAfter a stellar run post the COVID era, the entire ‘chemical’ space had a rough patch in last few months. SRF has been one of the rank outperformers in this pocket, underwent decent price as well as time wise correction since the latter half of calendar year 2022.On Friday, stock prices took off sharply to confirm a ‘Bullish Flag’ pattern on daily time frame chart. If we look at the volume activity, it has risen substantially, indicating strong buying interest at lower levels.We recommend buying this counter at current levels for a trading target of Rs 2,370. The stop-loss can be placed at Rs 2,230.Godrej Properties: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,208.75 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,160 | Target: Rs 1,300 | Return: 7.5 percentThis stock has been a laggard ever since it registered an all-time high of Rs 2,598 way back in October 2021. It has now reached its multi-year support cluster around Rs 1,150 – 1,200.Taking a broader view, the stock prices have precisely rebounded umpteen times after reaching this zone. On Friday, the way stock showed a positive stature throughout the session, it validates the importance of this support zone.On the daily time frame, we can see prices traversing '20-day EMA' (Rs 1,194) comfortably and looking at the momentum, we will not be surprised to see this move extending a bit.Traders are advised to buy for a near term target of Rs 1,300. The stop-loss can be placed at Rs 1,160.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

The stock price was in an intermediate down trend in the past and has declined as per lower tops and bottoms on the weekly chart. It seems to have formed a bottom reversal around Rs 1,900 level in December and moving up sustainably since then.The previous negative chart pattern is at the verge of turning into bullish formation like higher tops and bottoms. Hence, the stock price is expected to move up in the coming weeks. A sustainable move above Rs 2,200 level could be considered as a decisive upside breakout of the accumulation pattern. Daily 14 period RSI (relative strength index) shows positive indication.Buying can be initiated in Mphasis at CMP (Rs 2,153), add more on dips down to Rs 2,050, wait for the upside target of Rs 2,350 and next Rs 2,480 in the next 3-5 weeks, with a stop-loss at Rs 1,990.ICICI Lombard General Insurance: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,152 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,075 | Target: Rs 1,325 | Return: 15 percentAfter showing weakness within a broader range in the last one month, the stock price showed bottom reversal at the support of Rs 1,100 levels in the last couple of weeks.
