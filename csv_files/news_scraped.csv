"  February 06, 2023 / 10:23 AM IST  ",Aswath Damodaran dissects Adani crisis: What's the fair value of this 'competent' infra play?,"Valuation guru Aswath Damodaran believes that Adani Group, despite all its flaws, remains competent in India's infrastructure space that's full of incompetent players. He pegs the fair value for Adani Enterprises at Rs 947.""It is possible that Hindenburg was indulging in hyperbole when it described Adani to be 'the biggest con' in history. I am puzzled that Hindenburg's short thesis spends as much time as it does trying to convince us that the company is over-levered. Being over-levered is not a con game, but a risk that equity investors in many investments take to increase their returns,"" Damodaran wrote in his blog on Sunday.While valuing the stock at only Rs 947 apiece, he factored in upbeat assumptions on revenue growth and operating margins. That is a 38 percent downside from the stock's Friday close of Rs 1,531.The reason behind this, he says, is that the company's profitability has lagged, partly because investments take time to pay off and partly because it is in low-margin businesses.Also Read: Uday Kotak on Adani-Hindenburg fiasco: 'Don't see systemic risk to Indian financial system'""The market was over-stretched when it valued the Adani companies collectively at $220 billion (Rs 17,600 billion) and Adani Enterprises at $53 billion (Rs 4,243 billion),"" Damodaran said.Dissecting the group's debtFor his calculations, Damodaran has split the past 20-year history into three parts: 2002-2015 - when the company grew its revenues steadily; 2016-2021 - when major restructuring spun off Adani Ports, Adani Power and Adani Transmission; and the recent period, when the group bought Holcim's stake in ACC and Ambuja Cements.The debt to book capital ratio has stayed high through the period, but the rise in market capitalization in 2021 and 2022 lowered the debt to market capital ratio, he notes.""The interest coverage ratio better captures the limited buffer that the company has on its debt load, since the operating income is barely higher than interest expenses,"" Damodaran explained.Dissecting the ownership structureConsolidating across the Adani companies, the valuation guru explains that the family owns about 73 percent of the outstanding equity in these companies.Of the 27.5 percent that is not held by the family, a significant percentage is held by foreign institutional investors, largely through index funds holdings.""One benign explanation is that foreign institutional investors are using Adani listed shares to make a joint bet on Indian growth, infrastructure investment and Indian politics, and that the pricing was pushed up because of the limited float,"" he pointed out.Also Read: Adani Enterprises puts Rs 1,000-crore bond plan on backburner after market routMeanwhile, retail investor presence is small, while some traders have been drawn to the counters due to the surge in pricing over the past two years.Will he buy the stock?""No,"" he said. ""And, it has little to do with the Hindenburg report.""He likens buying shares in a family group company to ""getting married, and then having all of your in-laws move into the bedroom with you"".According to the finance professor at the NYU Stern School of Business, investors in family group companies are buying into cross-holdings, opacity and the possibility of wealth transfers across family group companies.""Those risks increase, if the family group companies are built around political connections, where you are one political election loss away your biggest competitive advantage,"" he notes.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol are their own and not those of the website or its management.

The exchanges have put these stocks under ASM effective from February 3 to curb short-selling, especially after recent sell-off in Adani Group stocks.However, the NSE has removed Ambuja Cements from the F&O ban list as per its circular dated February 3. The stock has posted 6 percent rally on last Friday on top of 5.5 percent gains in previous session.If derivative contracts in securities cross 95 percent of the market-wide position limit, they end up in the ban list, the NSE said.“All clients/members shall trade in the derivative contracts of the said security only to decrease their positions through offsetting positions. Any increase in open positions shall attract appropriate penal and disciplinary action,” it said.During the ban, traders are not allowed to take fresh positions in stocks but can start reducing their positions. The F&O ban rule helps reduce speculation in stocks.The market-wide position limit, which is set by stock exchanges, is the maximum number of outstanding open positions (buy and sell) in the F&O contracts of a security. If the open interest in a stock crosses 95 percent of the market-wide position limit, its F&O contracts enter the ban period.Normal trading in a security resumes only after the aggregate open interest across exchanges comes down to 80 percent or below the market-wide position limit, the NSE said.",Adani Enterprises Ltd.

Fortunately, things cooled off towards the end of the week, with the Nifty recovering smartly to reclaim the 17,800 mark on a closing basis.Though the index we managed to recover the lost ground, we are still not out of the woods completely. A continuous news flow about the Adani group is likely to lead to volatile swings on both sides.For the Nifty, the immediate support is at 17,600 but 17,400–17,300 remains the sacrosanct level, coinciding with the 200-day SMA (17,297). As long as the Nifty defends the level, there is no reason to worry.For a consistent up move, the Nifty needs to surpass 18,000– 18,100 on a closing basis, which would confirm the completion of the recent corrective phase.Traders are advised to keep a tab on the above-mentioned scenarios as well as global and domestic events.Here are two buy calls for the short term:Mahindra & Mahindra: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,388 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,348 | Target: Rs 1,460 | Return: 5 percentThe automobile space has bucked the trend in the past couple of weeks.

We expect this trend to continue, which should improve cigarette volumes and earnings visibility in the medium term.Nirmal BangThe brokerage house upgraded the stock to 'buy' with revised target price of Rs 465 from Rs 385.Rural demand did see a sequential improvement, it continues to remain relatively subdued, it observed.Changes to the model have led to 6.3 percent/6.2 percent/5.5 percent upward revision in FY23/FY24/FY25 EPS.Considering strong return ratios and consistent delivery by the company, the broking house is increasing its valuation multiple by 15 percent to 26.5x on September 2024 EPS.HDFC SecuritiesThe broking major retained the 'add' rating on the stock and revised the target price to Rs 385.With consistent stability in taxes and demand environment, it expects the volume CAGR to remain healthy in the coming quarters.

"  February 06, 2023 / 07:40 AM IST  ","ITC likely to hit Rs 460 this year, Persistent Systems may see profit booking, says this technical chartist","""ITC is beating the market and has been in an uptrend since the beginning of 2022. On the weekly charts, a bullish flag formation has broken out. The target level is somewhere around Rs 460,"" Santosh Meena, Head of Research, Swastika Investmart, said in an interview to Moneycontrol.Therefore, he expects ITC to hit at least Rs 460 this year. A move above the Rs 500 mark cannot be ruled out given the strong overall strength, added Santosh, who has more than 10 years of experience in the financial markets, with expertise in technical and derivative analysis.About Persistent Systems, he said that after a 25 percent rally in the current calendar year, the company ""…is near an important zone of Rs 4,950–5,000, where we can expect some profit booking. But if it manages to break out of this zone then we can expect a further rally towards Rs 5,250–5,000 levels,"" he added.What are the chances of the Nifty going breaking below 17,000 this year?It is challenging to assert that the Nifty is unlikely to go below the 17,000 level this calendar year given the fast-changing and volatile climate in which we live. However, there is a significant probability that the Nifty will be able to maintain its 200-day DMA, which is located around 17,300, in the near future. The fact that the Nifty is still in a bullish territory (above the 200-day daily moving average) in spite of the pessimism in the market shows that it is resilient.There is a good possibility that the Nifty will establish its base in the 17,500-17,000 zone for this calendar year if there are no further hiccups in the near future, but any unexpected negative events could cause the Nifty to fall below 17,000.Do you think the Nifty PSE index is still in a long consolidation mode, or is it trying to break out of the same?Since 2007, the Nifty PSE index has been moving in a range, with the upside cap being around the 4,500 mark and the base at 2,000. For a multi-year breakthrough that might trigger a significant rally in the PSU area, it must see a decisive move over the 4,500 level.A closer look at a smaller time frame reveals that the near-term base has moved to the 3,600 level and that a bullish flag is forming, which increases the possibility of an upside breakout in the near future.Are the charts telling you that Adani Group stocks will see some more correction in the coming days, or is there any value buying emerging in these stocks?If we look at the charts of the front-line Adani stocks — Adani Enterprises, Adani Ports, Ambuja Cement, ACC — there is a bullish hammer candlestick pattern, which is a classical sign of a near-term bottom.So we can expect temporary relief in these stocks, but there will be a risk of selling pressure at higher levels. However, if we look at the other stocks of the Adani Group, then there are still no signs of a reversal.Do you see any possibility of ITC going beyond Rs 500 in the current calendar year?ITC is beating the market and has been in an uptrend since the beginning of 2022. On the weekly charts, a bullish flag formation has broken out, if we look at the technical structure.The pattern's target level is somewhere around Rs 460. We can therefore expect at least Rs 460 in this year. A move above the Rs 500 mark cannot be ruled out given the strong overall strength.Do you think the current consolidation in the Nifty Auto index is likely to see a decisive breakout on the higher side, crossing the 14,000 mark in the coming weeks?The Nifty auto index is performing comparatively well. For the past six months, it has been consolidating in the 12,200–13,500 zone while developing a bullish flag pattern. There is considerable probability that it will these an upside in the near future, which may result in significant gains for auto stocks.The Nifty Auto Index's immediate target is the 14,000 level, and the target per the flag patterns is the 16,400 level.The biggest gainer in the current calendar year is Persistent Systems, up 25 percent so far YTD. Do you expect more run-up in the stock going ahead?Persistent Systems is gaining ground and outperforming the Nifty IT index. However, it is near an important supply zone of Rs 4,950–5,000 where we can expect some profit booking. If it manages to break out this zone, then we can expect a further rally towards Rs 5,250–5,000 levels. On the downside, Rs 4,400 will act as a strong support.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

"  February 06, 2023 / 06:01 AM IST  ","Hot Stocks | Here is why you should bet on Mahindra & Mahindra, Ashok Leyland for short term?","In the week gone by, the Adani group fiasco hit the market like an asteroid. The spillover of the carnage triggered a massive selloff in the banking space that soon spread to the broader market. Fortunately, things cooled off towards the end of the week, with the Nifty recovering smartly to reclaim the 17,800 mark on a closing basis.Though the index we managed to recover the lost ground, we are still not out of the woods completely. A continuous news flow about the Adani group is likely to lead to volatile swings on both sides.For the Nifty, the immediate support is at 17,600 but 17,400–17,300 remains the sacrosanct level, coinciding with the 200-day SMA (17,297). As long as the Nifty defends the level, there is no reason to worry.For a consistent up move, the Nifty needs to surpass 18,000– 18,100 on a closing basis, which would confirm the completion of the recent corrective phase.Traders are advised to keep a tab on the above-mentioned scenarios as well as global and domestic events.Here are two buy calls for the short term:Mahindra & Mahindra: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,388 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,348 | Target: Rs 1,460 | Return: 5 percentThe automobile space has bucked the trend in the past couple of weeks. This stock didn't participate in the broader market destruction and when things calmed down, it started moving in the upward direction.Stock prices clocked fresh record highs and confirmed a weekly close around them, indicating strength in the counter.On the weekly time-frame chart, we can see a positive crossover in ‘RSI-Smoothened’ oscillator. We recommend buying this stock for a trading target of Rs 1,460. The stop-loss can be placed at Rs 1,348.Ashok Leyland: Buy | LTP: Rs 153.90 | Stop-Loss: Rs 149 | Target: Rs 162 | Return: 5 percentWe will stick to the outperforming pocket and this stock has been resilient in recent weeks. The price has stayed 200-day SMA (Rs 145) for the last three months and developed a good accumulation price pattern.On February 3, we witnessed a breakout above recent hurdles on the closing basis and considering the decent volume activity, we expect the stock to continue its northward trajectory.Traders can look to buy for a near-term target of Rs 162. The stop-loss can be placed at Rs 149.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

"  February 06, 2023 / 11:56 AM IST  ",Voda Idea zooms 21% as govt clears conversion of debt to equity,"Shares of Vodafone Idea surged on February 6 after the company said the government has cleared the conversion of interest it owes on statutory debt into equity.As of 11.30, the stock zoomed 21 percent to trade at Rs 8.34 apiece on the BSE. However, this is still lower than the price at which the debt will be converted into equity, i.e., Rs 10 per share.Vodafone Idea will be converting Rs 16,133 crore of debt into equity. After the conversion, the government will own 1613 crore shares in the firm, which roughly translates into 33 percent stake.“We will not have any Board seat. Our holding will be classified as public shareholding,” DIPAM secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey has said.“Price has to be as per the law. Any conversion of loan into equity has to be at par value. Government cannot violate the law”, he replied, when he was asked why the conversion was done at Rs 10, when the market price was Rs 7.The move by the government, which comes after a wait of about a year, will make it the largest shareholder in the company. This also bestows confidence in the company’s sustainability. There are also reports that suggest promoters may infuse more money in the company now.However, not many see positives to sustain as the company is struggling to raise funds.CLSA, reiterating its sell rating on the stock with target price at Rs 6, underlined that the government will own 33 percent of the company on conversion of interest to equity. British Vodafone Group will hold 31.7 percent and Aditya Birla Group will hold 18.2 percent.“Govt is reportedly converting int dues after receiving commitment from promoters. It is converting interest dues to run the company and bring in necessary investment. We believe the company will still be in crisis to fund annual spectrum payments beyond 4-year moratorium,” CLSA said.The brokerage house believes Vodafone Idea will be in crisis unless its average revenue per user (ARPU) reaches Rs 300. As of September 2022 quarter, its ARPU was at Rs 131 – lowest among its peers.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

The company has been directed to issue 1,613 crore equity shares of the face value of Rs 10 each at an issue price of Rs 10 each, it said.On February 3, the stock ended the day at Rs 6.89.The development comes after months of waiting after the company showed its willingness to convert the debt into equity. The final communication in this regard will do away with uncertainty and bring down the debt on the book of the company.The total gross debt (excluding lease liabilities and including interest accrued but not due) as of September 30, 2022, stood at Rs 2,20,320 crore, comprising deferred spectrum payment obligations of Rs 1,36,650 crore (including Rs 17260 crore towards spectrum acquired in recent spectrum auction) and AGR liability of Rs 68,590 crore that is due to the Government, and debt from banks and financial institutions of Rs 15,080 crore.Cash & cash equivalents were at Rs 190 crore while net debt stood at Rs 2,20,130 crore.Once the debt gets converted into equity, the government will become the largest shareholder in the company.",Vodafone Idea Ltd.
