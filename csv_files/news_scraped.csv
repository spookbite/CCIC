In October 2022, the stock experienced a significant surge in price, nearly doubling in value from October to December. However, after this strong rally, the stock entered a period of consolidation both in terms of price and time.Recently, the stock has formed what can be described as a quasi ""Double Bottom"" pattern, and it broke above this pattern today. In the coming trading sessions, it will be crucial for the stock to maintain its position above Rs 84 levels to avoid an extension of the consolidation period.If it manages to sustain above this level, the stock has the potential to reach levels around Rs 110-115, indicating a possible further upward movement.Jubilant FoodworksThe stock underwent a significant price correction from September 2022 to the end of that year.
