Some banks have disclosed their potential impact at 4-5 percent of loans, which includes non-ECL-related capital requirements for Ind-AS as well (which is not in the pipeline as of now). On ECL provisioning deficit, it's tough to estimate the exact impact pending final guidelines"", Morgan Stanley said in its recent report.The brokerage firm has adopted a more discerning approach towards state-run banks and downgraded Punjab National Bank (PNB) to an underweight rating from equal weight. It favors Bank of Baroda (BOB), Bank of India (BOI), and State Bank of India (SBI) due to their stronger balance sheets when compared to Canara Bank and PNB.In January 2023, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) initiated the process of gathering feedback on the ECL-based loss provisioning model by issuing a discussion paper.

"  May 10, 2023 / 05:43 PM IST  ","Dr Reddy's Q4 net profit jumps to Rs 959 crore on favourable base, US launches, brand deals","Pharmaceutical major Dr Reddy's Laboratories recorded a manifold rise in its net profit to Rs 959.2 crore for the fourth quarter that ended March 31, from Rs 87.5 crore in the same period last year.The net profit in the base quarter was hit by impairment charges, price erosion and increased competition in the US market, Dr Reddy's Laboratories said in an exchange filing.

"  May 10, 2023 / 07:58 PM IST  ","L&T’s FY24 revenue growth seen at 12-15%, order intake growth at 10-12%: CFO","Larsen & Toubro Ltd's management expects the engineering major's revenue to grow at 12-15 percent and order intake growth at 10-12 percent in 2023-24 but is cautious of slowing government activity in the second half of the fiscal, in view of the Union Elections that will take place in 2024.On May 10, L&T reported its financial result for 2022-23 where it exceeded the revenue and order inflow growth guidance of 12-15 percent. The company, however, missed its guidance for margin which declined year-on-year.“We are conscious of the fact that towards the end of current year FY24 the country gets into Union Elections. In a sense, we will have to look at this year as a truncated year…we will have to wait and watch depending on how the election mode interferes with decision making on some of these projects,” said Chief Financial Officer R Shankar Raman.L&T’s consolidated order book stood at Rs 399,526 crore as on March 31, 2023, with international orders accounting for 28 percent. Order inflow in the fiscal was Rs 230,528 crore, up 19 percent year-on-year, beating the 12-15 percent guidance. Government-backed domestic infrastructure orders were among the top drivers for order inflow.“There could be some slowdown in new project announcements because as we move closer to the election, the government could be more focused on what catches the voters’ interest. If they are still fighting for ‘roti-kapda-makaan’, some of the allocations could go towards priority sectors,” Raman said.He added that the better-than-expected tax collection for the government may support capex.Post Covid execution weighed on marginRaman said that while L&T’s Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortisation (EBITDA) margin declined to 8.6 percent in FY24 from 9.3 percent a year ago, the company aims to improve it to 9 percent  in FY24.L&T reported consolidated revenues of Rs 183,341 crore for the year ended March 31, 2023, up 17 percent on year, driven by strong execution of a large order book in the infrastructure projects segment and robust momentum in the information technology and services segment.But even as the company tried to make up for lost time during the pandemic by pushing execution, the higher cost of execution dented the EBITDA margin.“The margins that we reported in FY22 was about 9.3 percent. As we started FY23, the idea was to protect the margin and see whether we can work on improving it. But for the revenue to grow, we had to complete contractual obligations and beyond a certain point we had to take the input cost in our stride and complete the project to make up for the loss of time in the previous year due to Covid,” Raman said.",Larsen & Toubro Ltd.
"  May 10, 2023 / 07:09 AM IST  ",L&T Preview: Better execution to boost Q4 topline; large order wins to raise margins,"The engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) major, Larsen & Toubro (L&T), is seen reporting lukewarm numbers on a year-on-year (YoY) basis, but the sequential performance could enthuse the Street, indicates a poll of brokerages conducted by Moneycontrol.As per the poll, the company’s consolidated revenue for the March quarter is expected to come in at Rs 58,839.13 crore, a growth of 11.3 percent YoY, and 26.8 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ). Some analysts highlighted that a pick-up in execution could drive revenue growth. Net profit is likely to rise 1.6 percent YoY, and 63.8 percent QoQ to Rs 4,182.10 crore. L&T estimates for Q4Kotak Institutional Equities sees a 10 percent YoY improvement in core EPC revenues, as it bakes in improved construction activity across projects in Q4 FY23. It believes the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) margin of the company’s core engineering and construction business will expand 40 basis points (bps) YoY to 10.4 percent, driven by lower commodity prices.Overall, the brokerage firm sees margin at 12.4 percent in the March quarter, up from 10.9 percent in the previous quarter, and 12.3 percent in Q4 FY22.Talking about sales, Prabhudas Lilladher expects consolidated revenue growth of 11.6 percent YoY, led by growth in IT, energy projects, hi-tech manufacturing, and developmental projects.L&T is well-placed to benefit from overall diversified tender prospects with better order conversion in the domestic market, significant traction in capital expenditure (capex) from oil exporting countries, mainly the hydrocarbon segment, and expected uptick in private capex, the brokerage firm said. It expects L&T to report a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.2 percent and 19.8 percent in revenue and profit after tax, respectively, between FY22-FY25.Order inflowAnalysts believe that order inflow for most capital goods companies is expected to be robust, as those announced by companies like L&T, KEC International, VA Tech Wabag, ISGEC Heavy Engineering, and BEL have been encouraging.“Strong tender pipeline from domestic as well as exports markets is likely to drive order inflows,” according to brokerage house Prabhudas Lilladher.Read more | Cheaper pizzas, burgers! Zomato starves in trade as ONDC poses a threatDuring the quarter, L&T announced orders in the range of Rs 21,000-34,000 crore.Kotak Institutional Equities has factored in inflows of Rs 63,000 crore for Q4 FY23. Announced order inflows for the quarter so far are lower, and mostly includes orders from hydrocarbon, water, B&F, metals and mining, and transmission, the brokerage firm said.“Players like L&T and KEC are expected to report strong double-digit growth rates for FY23 inflows,” ICICI Securities said.HDFC Securities is of the view that L&T will witness improved order inflow and likely improvement in core margins owing to improved bid discipline, commodities price correction, and large-size order wins.Key monitorablesAs per analysts, management outlook on order pipeline, margin trajectory, working capital, and cash flow management would be key monitorables.“Management commentary on status of non-core assets like Nabha Power, Metro ridership and financial assistance will be key monitorables,” Prabhudas Lilladher said.",Larsen & Toubro Ltd.
