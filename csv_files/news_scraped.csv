"  June 13, 2023 / 05:44 PM IST  ","In five charts: How ZEEL’s funds were routed back to itself, according to Sebi ","On June 12, the market regulator barred Essel Group Chairman Subhash Chandra and Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEEL) CEO Punit Goenka from holding any directorial or key managerial position in listed companies or their subsidiaries.Chandra and Goenka have approached the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) with an appeal against the order.The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) passed the interim order after its investigations showed that Chandra and Goenka had diverted money from the listed entity by layering of transactions, which sometimes even involved the money passing through 13 entities in two days.Also read: ZEEL: SEBI bars promoters; what should investors do?Investigation into the company’s affairs started in 2019 when two independent directors resigned after it was revealed that Chandra had given— without informing the company’s Board — a Letter of Comfort (LoC) that made ZEEL’s Rs 200 crore fixed deposit available to settle loans of the group’s unlisted, associate entities.ZEEL later claimed that the money had been paid back by the associate entities that year in September/October, but further investigation by Sebi showed that ZEEL’s money had been routed through a complex web of companies and then back to itself. That is, ZEEL’s money had been used to pay itself back.In some instances, money of other listed entities of the group — Zee Media Corporation and Dish TV India — was used to repay debts of the unlisted, private entities.The investigators estimated that at least Rs 143.90 crore had been transferred from ZEEL/other listed companies of Essel Group through such routing of funds, “to falsely portray repayment of due amounts to ZEEL from Associate Entities”.Here are five charts that show how this routing was done.ZEEL claimed to have received Rs 17.10 crore from Essel Green Mobility (EGML) on September 27,019.But the following flowchart (as given in the Sebi order) shows that the payment ZEEL received on that date had originated in the bank account of ZEEL on September 26, 2019. Source: Sebi orderZEEL claimed to have received Rs 17.40 crore from Living Entertainment Enterprises (LEEPL) and Rs 49.30 crore from Pan India Network Infravest Ltd (PINIL) on October 1, 2019.But the chart below shows how the money ZEEL was supposed to have received from LEEPL and PINIL had originated from Zee Studios, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ZEEL, on September 30, 2019.On October 10, 2019, ZEEL was said to have received Rs 23 crore from Essel Business Excellence Services (EBESPL).But, the chart below shows that the money for this had originated from ZEEL on October 7, 2019.ZEEL claimed to have received Rs 14.80 crore from Pan India Infraprojects (PIIPL) on September 26, 2019.The below chart shows how this money had originated from the bank account of Zee Akaash News, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Zee Media Corporation, a listed company of the Essel Group.ZEEL had said that it had received Rs 22.30 crore from Essel Corporate Resources (ECRPL) on September 30, 2019. But the flowchart below shows how the money had come from Dish Infra Services (DISPL) a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dish TV India, a listed company under the Essel group.“The above flow of funds clearly indicates that there was no actual net receipt of funds by ZEEL and these were merely book entries to show receipt of funds,” stated the Sebi order.Also read: Zee shares recover, but speculation continues over company's merger with Sony“The funds diverted from ZEEL/other listed companies had ultimately benefitted the Promoter Family, as the Associate Entities which were the beneficiaries of appropriation of ZEEL’s FD of Rs.200 Crore by Yes Bank for settlement of their liabilities are owned/controlled by the Promoter Family of ZEEL,” stated the order.It added that the fund trail of the balance amount — Rs 200 crore minus Rs 143 crore that has been routed thus — is still under examination. The order added, “the possibility that the same (the balance amount) has also been siphoned off from ZEEL/other listed companies of Essel Group cannot be ruled out”.",Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd.
"  June 13, 2023 / 01:23 PM IST  ","SEBI order against Goenka may only delay Zee-Sony merger, say experts","The market regulator’s order against Punit Goenka, MD of Zee Entertainment Enterprises, may delay the company’s merger with Sony Pictures Networks India, but it won’t be called off, experts said.The order does not create an embargo on the merger, said Sandeep Bajaj, managing partner at PSL Advocates & Solicitors.“Goenka was supposed to be the MD and CEO of the merged entity. However, now Sony and Zee will have to amend the scheme and propose a new CEO and MD unless the SEBI order is overturned,” Bajaj said.The Securities and Exchange Board of India, in an interim order on June 12, banned Essel Group chairman Subhash Chandra and his son Goenka from holding any directorial or key managerial position for siphoning funds from Zee for their own benefit.SEBI’s direction is an interim one and the directors can file their replies or objections within 21 days, advocate Shashank Agarwal said. He said the larger implications of the actions that led to the order cannot be ignored.Also Read: Sebi bars Subhash Chandra, Punit Goenka from holding directorial, key managerial roles“The merger can still happen, irrespective of this order and without Punit Goenka on board. However, it may get delayed as Sony might have to reconsider the larger scheme of things in light of this order,” he said.SEBI’s order is likely to further delay the already dragged-out merger, said Sangeeta Jhunjhunwala, a partner at Khaitan Legal Associates.NCLT hearings“However, given that the order of SEBI is only interim and appealable, its precise impact on the NCLT (National Company Law Tribunal) process will become known in time,” Jhunjhunwala said.On May 11, the NCLT asked the BSE and the National Stock Exchange of India to reconsider Zee's proposed merger with Sony Pictures Networks in light of the fund diversion case involving Shirpur Gold Refinery, an Essel Group company. However, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal set aside the NCLT order. The next hearing in the NCLT is scheduled for June 16.While the NCLT proceedings on the Zee-Sony merger were expected to be completed in one or two hearings, the matter could get stretched if NCLT notes SEBI's concerns against Goenka, a person aware of the development said.Also Read: Zee Ent slumps after SEBI cracks down on Chandra, Goenka; Sony merger under a cloud“Zee will file an appeal with SAT (Securities Appellate Tribunal) against the SEBI order. This is likely to happen over the next one day, post a board meeting. SAT will either grant a stay against the SEBI order or dismiss Zee Entertainment's plea,” said Karan Taurani, senior vice president at Elara Capital.He said that according to legal experts, the SAT usually gives a decision 24 to 48 hours after a plea is filed. If the SAT stays the SEBI order, it will lead to the merger getting delayed extensively, he said.""In case of the second outcome (Zee's plea gets dismissed), Sony will continue to go ahead with the merger with a new CEO, which means a change in the merger arrangement,"" he said. ""We don't think that Sony would back out of the merger in case Punit Goenka is not able to hold a key managerial position.""He added that a change in the management within the merger scheme will not require approval from the exchanges and may only need endorsement from the ministry of information and broadcasting, which could take a few weeks.Shriram Subramanian, founder of InGovern Research Services, a proxy advisory firm, said SEBI's order does not impose restrictions or indict Zee.""It should not have a major impact on the merger process. While it is damaging to Punit Goenka, it is likely to be challenged in a higher court. There would be a scenario of Goenka giving up the role of MD so as not to hold back the merger,"" he said.The Zee-Sony merger, announced in 2021, was expected to conclude by the end of August. Sony Corp. CEO Kenichiro Yoshida said during the annual corporate strategy meeting in May he expected the merger to be completed by the first half of FY24.Goenka said during a Q4 earnings call that legal matters remotely connected to the company have been addressed. He also said the team is taking steps to ensure there are no further hindrances and expressed hope for positive developments on the merger front.",Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd.

"  June 13, 2023 / 10:46 AM IST  ","Zee Ent slumps after SEBI cracks down on Chandra, Goenka; Sony merger under a cloud","Zee Entertainment shares opened 4 percent lower on June 13, a day after the market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) barred chairman Subhash Chandra and CEO Punit Goenka from holding any key managerial positions.The order came after a SEBI investigation found that the father-son duo abused their positions as directors/KMPS of a listed company for siphoning off funds.At 9:30 am, Zee Entertainment was quoting at Rs 186.35 on the NSE, down 4.36 percent from the previous close. The company has already informed exchanges that the board is in the process of reviewing the SEBI order and legal advice being sought to take the next steps.Follow our live blog for all the market action""The Noticees alienated the assets of ZEEL and other listed companies of Essel Group for the benefit of associate entities, which are owned and controlled by them. The siphoning of funds appears to be a well-planned scheme since, in some instances the layering of transactions involved using as many as 13 entities as pass-through entities within a short period of two days only,"" the SEBI order said. The associate entity it referred to is Shirpur Gold Refinery.SEBI added that there were no processes and structures inside ZEEL to stop poor governance practices and that the flagship company ""used like a piggybank by the Noticees (Chandra and Goenka)"".The investigators pointed to the share price of ZEEL falling from Rs 600 to Rs 200 over FY19 to FY23, despite the company being so profitable, and said it showed that ""all was not well with the company"".  It added, that during the period, the promoter shareholding dropped from 41.62 percent to the current level of 3.99 percent.What happens to Zee-Sony merger?On May 11, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had asked BSE and NSE to reconsider Zee's proposed merger with Sony Pictures Networks India in the light of the Shirpur Gold Refinery fund diversion case. However, National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) set aside the NCLT order.The next hearing in NCLT is scheduled for June 16.As of now, Goenka is slated to be the MD and CEO of the merged company, as per the scheme of arrangement. With SEBI's order, this becomes a key roadblock for the merger.""There are two possible outcomes to the SEBI order - one, that it delays the merger process as Goenka and Chandra appeal against the SEBI order. On the other hand, it remains to be seen how Sony will react to this news and whether the positive business implications of the merger outweigh the governance concerns getting raised against ZEEL's promoters,"" said Hetal Dalal of Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IIAS).The Zee-Sony merger, expected to be completed by the first half of the current fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, has run into several roadblocks. Earlier, ZEEL was dragged by its operational and financial creditors over a delay in payment of dues. Now, the merger stares at a new obstruction.""We will have to wait and watch,"" said Dalal.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.
