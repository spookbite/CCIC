"  January 20, 2023 / 02:50 PM IST  ",Reduce AU Small Finance Bank; target of Rs 610: HDFC Securities,"HDFC Securities' research report on AU Small Finance BankAUBANK posted its highest-ever quarterly earnings on the back of lower-thanexpected credit costs (30bps annualised), partly offset by elevated operating expenses. The bank calibrated its loan growth (+38% YoY) to mirror the growth in deposits (~400bps QoQ rundown in CASA), resulting in moderation across segments such as wheels, home loans, and commercial banking. In a rising interest rate environment, AUBANK has chosen to remain conservative in order to protect its margins and asset quality. However, continued investments in franchise-building and new businesses are likely to be a drag on medium-term profitability vectors.OutlookWe continue to watch out for signs of operating leverage and the impact of incremental rate transmission on margins. We tweak our FY23E/FY24E estimates by +6% each for better risk-adjusted margins; maintain REDUCE, with a TP of INR610 (3.1x Sep-24 ABVPS).For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

"  January 20, 2023 / 02:20 PM IST  ",Hold AU Small Finance Bank; target of Rs 650: Emkay Global Financial,"Emkay Global Financial's research report on AU Small Finance BankAU SFB reported higher-than-expected PAT at Rs3.9bn vs. our estimate of Rs3.6bn, mainly due to stable margins and lower LLP, partly offset by higher opex. Bank utilized contingent provisions to the tune of Rs0.3bn, with asset quality in better control as GNPA ratio improved QoQ to 1.8%. Credit growth remained strong at 38% YoY/7% QoQ, mainly led by strong corporate/SME growth and healthy retail growth. Growth in the wheels portfolio remains relatively moderate amid rising rates, while other retail segments report strong traction. Management has guided to balance growth with margins. Bank awaits guidelines from the RBI for applying for the universal banking license, while term-extension applications for MD & CEO Sanjay Agarwal and WTD Uttam Tibrewal are pending with the RBI. We largely retain our earnings estimates and expect RoA/RoE at 1.7%/15-17% over FY23-25E, as leverage improves.OutlookWe retain our HOLD rating on the stock, with a TP of Rs650/share, given rich valuations. That said, we believe AU’s maneuvering the rising rate cycle without taking much impact on its otherwise-higher return ratios as well as raising compliance/governance standards will be closely tracked, as it prepares to apply for the Universal Banking Licence. Recent ECL norms too could be cumbersome for the bank, given its lower PCR and relatively-high risk model.For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

NBM is a system used by insurers to measure the cost of and profit from writing new policies.Successful journey on NBMsHDFC Life has delivered superior NBMs for several quarters now, and this has supported its valuations in the market. For Q2FY23, the life insurer’s margin was 25.8 percent.A superior product mix, with a healthy share of margin-friendly protection business, has been behind the insurer’s stellar numbers.“New business premium to see a healthy growth; expect strong trends in annuity/non-par (non-participatory) segments,” wrote analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.Analysts at Jefferies India Pvt Ltd expect the life insurer’s strong growth to drive profitability for the quarter. HDFC Life witnessed a 15 percent growth in new business on an annualized premium equivalent (APE) basis for the December quarter, as per company-wise business data from the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA).The company’s APE stood at Rs 2,990 crore, as of December. The 15 percent expansion comes over a 20 percent growth in the corresponding quarter last year, an indication that the life insurer has been able to boost its business.“HDFC Life seems to have turned the corner on growth, with a 23 percent individual APE growth, following a 47 percent growth in November 2022 after a few weak (-17% to +15%) ones in the preceding five months,” noted analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities in a January 9 report.To be sure, part of the growth is also due to the acquisition of Exide Life that concluded in October. Exide Life’s product book performance would be a key monitorable for investors. The management’s outlook on growth in the coming quarters as well as improvement in persistency ratios will also be keenly watched.",HDFC Life Insurance Company Ltd.

While HUL gained 10ppt margins between 2013 to 2023, however given current margin band of 23-25%, 80bps royalty rate increase over 3 years will curtail margin expansion.

"  January 20, 2023 / 10:55 AM IST  ",ICICI Bank Q3 Preview: Expect a robust all-round act; 29% net profit growth,"ICICI Bank Ltd is expected to deliver a robust set of operating metrics for the December quarter, powered by a strong loan growth, core interest income expansion and reduction in stressed loans.The private sector lender is expected to report a net profit of Rs. 7,994 crore for the quarter, up 29 percent from a year ago period, the average estimate of seven securities firms showed. Net interest income (NII) is expected to have grown 28 percent Year-on-Year (YoY) to Rs 15,639 crore for the three months ended December.The bank will detail its quarterly earnings on January 21.The healthy growth in NII is expected on the back of double-digit loan growth and an expansion in the net interest margin. Coupled with traction in non-interest r income, the bank is expected to report an operating profit of Rs 12,193 crore, a YoY increase of 20 percent.ICICI Bank’s loan book has expanded around 20 percent consistently for several quarters now and analysts expect the bank to have repeated this performance in the December quarter as well.  “Loan growth to be solid at 20%, led by healthy contribution from all segments,” wrote analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities in a note.  In the September quarter, the lender had reported 23 percent growth in its corporate loans and 25 percent expansion in retail loans.In an interaction with analysts earlier this month, the bank’s management laid out its plans for faster business growth and reduction in costs by relying heavily on technology and digitization. The bank has multiple times pushed its digital heft through a super app that provides prospective and existing customers with a full stack of products of the ICICI Group as well as other financial companies.Some of these efforts may reflect in the credit growth number of the bank for the third quarter as well. Further, ICICI Bank’s management also indicated its focus on loans to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) during public interactions in the previous quarters.“As highlighted in our recent notes, we see strong opportunity for ICICI Bank in SME space where it has customised offerings for micro-segments and offered many firsts to clients,” analysts at Jefferies India Pvt Ltd wrote in a note. SME loans form 4.4 percent of the bank’s total book. Retail and SME loans fetch more bang for the buck as they carry wider spreads compared with loans to large companies.Margin heftBanks hiked deposit rates sharply during the December quarter and ICICI Bank was not an outlier. Ergo, the lender is likely to have witnessed an increase in its cost of funds. The bank’s margins have expanded for three straight quarters now and may show a marginal increase in the December quarter as well despite headwinds from deposit rate hikes.“Margins would continue to expand however at a slower rate, as CoF goes up,” analysts at Prabhudas Lilladher wrote in their note. CoF is short for cost of funds. The lender had hiked its deposit rates thrice during the quarter by 50-100 basis points across tenures. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.Analysts believe that the mix of its loan book and a slower repricing of its deposits limit the impact on margins unlike some of its smaller peers. The share of low-cost current and savings accounts for ICICI Bank is high, at 45 percent as of the September quarter. As stated earlier, the bank’s loan mix has tilted towards retail and small businesses that are conducive to margins. Further, within retail, the bank has grown its unsecured personal loan book faster than the other categories, which supports margins.Stress out of sightAnalysts expect the bank to report a reduction in fresh slippages for the quarter, thereby bringing down its provisioning needs. The gross bad loan pile is expected to decrease on an aggregate level as well. In the September quarter, the bank had reported a gross bad loan ratio of 3.19 percent, a sharp fall from 4.82 percent a year ago.“We expect provisions to remain at low levels, given lower slippages and better trends on recovery/upgradation. We are building in slippages of 2% (Rs.50 billion), but we see a solid commentary on recovery to continue resulting in lower stress coming from asset quality perspective,” the Kotak note said.",ICICI Bank Ltd.

The company had reported a net profit of Rs 20,539 crore in the same quarter last year. Company officials said higher finance costs were due to interest rate hikes by central banks and higher loan balances.According to an analyst poll conducted by Moneycontrol, its net profit was expected to grow 4.4 percent to Rs 16,366 crore from a year earlier. Revenue was expected to rise 21 percent YoY to Rs 2.23 lakh crore.The company said its EBITDA increased by 13.5 percent YoY to Rs 38,460 crore ($4.6 billion), on account of strong growth in the subscriber base for its digital business, growth across consumption baskets, improvement in middle distillate cracks and higher gas price realisation with an increase in ceiling price, and marginally higher volumes in the Oil & Gas segment.Also Read: Reliance Retail's Q3 revenue jumps 17%, net profit up 6.2% on highest ever footfalls""All segments contributed to the robust growth in consolidated EBITDA on a YoY basis,"" said Mukesh D.

Its revenue from operations was at 24,892 crore, up 20.9 percent YoY. EBITDA increased 25.1 percent YoY to 12,519 crore.Revenue growth was driven by a steady increase in both the subscriber base and average revenue per user (ARPU) for the connectivity business. EBITDA increase led by revenue growth and margin improvement, the company said, adding that EBITDA margin increased by 170 basis points due to increased ARPU and benefit from lower spectrum usage charges.Net subscriber addition was 5.3 million as gross adds remained strong at 34.2 million in 3Q FY23, RIL said.

The quarter also recorded the highest-ever footfalls at 201 million across formats and geographies.The company said Digital Commerce and New Commerce businesses continue to demonstrate the strength of their business model and grew 38 percent YoY and contributed to 18 percent of the revenue.“Our performance during the quarter demonstrates the underlying strengths and efficiencies of our business model that enable us to serve our customers with excellence at all times,"" said Isha M Ambani, Executive Director, Reliance Retail Ventures. ""We remain steadfast in offering the best shopping experience across all our stores and digital platforms to deepen our bond with our customers and vendor partners.”O2CSegmental revenue for the oil to chemicals (O2C) business rose 10 percent YoY to Rs 1,44,630 crore. EBITDA increased 2.9 percent to Rs 13,926 crore.Commenting on the energy vertical, group Joint CFO V Srikanth said, “Energy businesses accounted for 70% of incremental growth on a quarter-on-quarter basis.” He said that the oil and gas segment maintained stable production and higher realisation led to higher contribution.”Revenues increased on account of higher price realisation as crude oil prices went up by 11 percent year-on-year, said the company in a press release. Revenue growth was constrained by lower throughput with planned Maintenance & Inspection activity turnaround during the quarter. Srikanth added, “Volatile price environment and weak demand from China impacted downstream margin.”Growth in EBITDA was supported by strength in middle distillate cracks. This was, however, partially offset by weak margins across polymer, polyester chain and light distillates products. Continued SAED (special additional excise duty) on transportation fuels also impacted earnings by Rs 1,898 crore, RIL added.The company sees Middle Distillate cracks to remain firm on lower inventories, seasonal demand, and the impending loss of Russian oil products. Meanwhile, petrochemical feedstock price volatility will likely continue amidst uncertain geopolitical situations and recessionary trends in developed economies, it said.Srikanth attributed the quarter-on-quarter 12% decline in crude oil prices to demand and recession fears in Europe, the USA. However, the official added, India’s demand for fuels and downstream products remained strong even as global demand declined.RIL management said that the global oil demand is estimated to grow by 1.9 million barrels per day in 2023, led by the US, China and India. Srikanth said that some of the new capacity that will be commissioned in the second half of 2023r would result in an effective net global refining capacity addition of around 1 million barrels per day, so while their margin will get some support, the upside would be limited.Oil & GasThe company’s outlook for the gas market remains positive. “Gas price realization is expected to remain high in near-time even though some cool-off has happened,” said Sanjay Roy, Senior Vice President –exploration and production at RIL.The average gas price realised for KGD6 was at $11.3/MMBTU in 3QFY23 vs $6.1/MMBTU in 3Q FY22, with the raising of gas price ceiling to $12.46/MMBtu by the Government of India.RIL said geopolitical uncertainty and constrained supply are likely to keep gas prices firm in the near term while incremental production and higher prices will support EBITDA growth in the near term.MediaNet profit for its media business was at Rs 9 crore, down 97.1 percent YoY. Revenue from operations, meanwhile, increased 11.6 percent to Rs 1,850 crore primarily driven by the movies and sports business amidst a challenging advertising environment.RIL Q3 Earnings Highlights: Revenue up 15% YoY; board approves Rs 20,000 crore fundraisingThe continued softness in the macroeconomic environment dampened the advertising demand and ad revenue of all our segments was down on a YoY basis, RIL said. EBITDA declined sharply on YoY basis with the drop in advertising revenue directly impacting margins as investments in content continued with a view to consolidating operating metrics.The company said inflation has been showing signs of cooling off, but the revival of consumer demand remains crucial for growth in the media business. Our strong positions across verticals put us in a pole position to grow once the macroeconomic environment normalises, it added.",Reliance Industries Ltd.
