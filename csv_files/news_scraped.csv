"  January 05, 2023 / 12:37 PM IST  ",India’s Green Hydrogen Mission: These companies have committed to transition,"The government of India while clearing the National Green Hydrogen mission on January 4 also earmarked incentives worth Rs 17,490 crore for its production and manufacturing of electrolysers.But even as details of how these incentives will be rolled out are yet to be announced, a host of private sector conglomerates have already made pitches to go big on green hydrogen. Some of them announced their targets way back in 2021 when Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman first revealed about India’s plan to harness green hydrogen in her 2021 budget speech and later, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the National Hydrogen Energy Mission in his Independence Day speech in August the same year.For starters, green hydrogen is produced using renewable energy through electrolysis and thus, is carbon free. In this process, hydrogen is separated from oxygen in the water through an electric current. Renewable sources, such as solar or wind, are used in the requirement for electricity for electrolysis and hence, the colour “green” is attributed to this form of hydrogen.Moneycontrol takes a look at what companies have promised to accelerate India’s green hydrogen mission.ADANI GROUPOn June 14, 2022, Adani New Industries Ltd (ANIL) announced that it has partnered with France’s TotalEnergies SE to invest $50 billion over the next 10 years in India to produce green hydrogen and develop an ecosystem around it.In the initial phase, ANIL aims to develop green hydrogen production capacity of 1 million ton per annum before 2030.Last month (December, 2022), ANIL signed a development and licensing agreement with Cavendish Renewable Technology (CRT), a Melbourne based hydrogen technology firm, for development of alkaline electrolyses, polymer exchange membrane (PEMs), anion exchange membranes (AEMs) and CRT’s innovative “C-Cell” technology for mass scale production.RELIANCE INDUSTRIES LTD (RIL)On August 29, 2022, Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries said the company aims to transition to green hydrogen production, from grey now, by 2025. The company aims to reduce the production cost of green hydrogen to under $1/kg by the end of this decade.According to sources, RIL is in advanced talks with Hinduja-owned truck and bus maker Ashok Leyland for the development and supply chain of hydrogen-powered engines.Bloomberg on January 5 reported that Mukesh Ambani will be focusing his attention on RIL’s pivot to green energy. The 65-year-old will oversee strategy, including the building of gigafactories and blue hydrogen facilities, will assess acquisition targets, and is talking to potential investors, the people said, asking not to be named as the information isn’t public.Ambani last year unveiled plans to spend $75 billion on clean energy projects over the next 15 years.INDIAN OIL CORPORATION LTD (IOCL)IOCL is targeting to replace at least a tenth of its current fossil-fuel-based hydrogen at its refineries with green hydrogen as part of a decarbonisation drive. This year, the company is also going to set up subsidiary to house its green energy businesses.“The company is venturing into green hydrogen production and is targeting 5 percent of hydrogen produced by it as green hydrogen by 2027-28 and 10 per cent by 2029-30,” the PSU’s 2022 annual report stated.To start with, the nation's largest oil firm is setting up green hydrogen plants at its Panipat and Mathura refineries.Besides, Chennai petroleum corporation, a subsidiary of IOCL, has recently issued an EOI for the design, manufacturing and commissioning f the electrolyser and related items for the production of green hydrogen at its refinery at Manali in Chennai.ONGCIn July, 2022, India’s state-controlled Oil & Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and joint venture partner Greenko inked a pact to spend up to $6.2 billion on renewable energy and green hydrogen projects.GREENKO-KEPPEL DEALIn October, 2022, Greenko Group announced that India will for the first-time export green energy from 2025, with the first shipments going to a Singapore power plant as it signed a MoU with Singapore's Keppel Infrastructure.Through the MoU, the two companies will explore opportunities in green hydrogen in India.

"  January 05, 2023 / 10:05 AM IST  ",India’s $2-billion green hydrogen mission needs push from government: Industry,"India has made a serious bet of over $2 billion on green hydrogen and entered the global race for developing green energy to ensure the country’s energy security, but the devil lies in the details. The industry which made a beeline to enter the sector even before the country announced its policy, now awaits the details of the plan.On January 4, the Union Cabinet approved the National Green Hydrogen Mission with a total initial outlay of Rs 19,744 crore. The country wants to develop manufacturing capacity for the clean energy source and emerge as a global hub for it.While Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the ‘National Hydrogen Mission’ from the Red Fort on Independence Day in 2021, this is the first concrete commitment towards the ambition to boost the growth of green hydrogen in the country. The ministry had launched a part of the national hydrogen policy on February 17, but that did not include incentives that the industry was vying for.“The Indian government is among the first few to have put the money on the table for green hydrogen; it is in the top four-five countries that have committed money. Now that the ministry knows that they have this kitty to work with, they will work out the exact mechanics of who gets what, and the procedure. Unfortunately, there is no existing template for the incentives, as this is a new space. So, they will have to work it out, but they have been engaging with the industry closely,” Rajat Seksaria, Chief Executive Officer, ACME Group, told Moneycontrol.But while India has thrown its hat in the ring, its success hinges on how the incentives would be planned and executed, and how the country manages to create demand locally.The big pushIndia aims to produce at least five million tonnes (MT) of green hydrogen per annum by 2030, with a potential to reach 10 MT per annum that could even cater to the export market. The country hopes to progressively replace hydrogen produced from fossil fuels with the cleaner green hydrogen in petroleum refining and fertiliser production.Industry players told Moneycontrol that the timing of the Cabinet approval, just ahead of the Union Budget that is scheduled to be announced on February 1, indicates that the government is making sure that resources are made available to finance this initiative.Of the Rs 19,744 crore outlay announced, around Rs 17,490 crore will be towards incentives for production of green hydrogen and manufacturing of electrolysers. The government is referring to this as the Strategic Interventions for Green Hydrogen Transition Programme (SIGHT). Another Rs 1,466 crore will be for pilot projects, while Rs 400 crore is committed to research and development (R&D), and Rs 388 crore to other mission components, respectively.The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) will formulate the scheme guidelines for implementation of the respective components, Union Minister Anurag Thakur said in a briefing to reporters after the approval. Industry players are hopeful that this will be done in the next two months since the government has been engaging with the industry for over a year and has already received feedback.“Indian hydrogen demand is anticipated to see a five-fold jump to 28 MT by 2050, along with tremendous opportunities that exist for exports. The impetus will translate into increased cooperation between the government, private players and innovators to make green hydrogen, the fuel of the future, and India, a leader in the green energy space,” said Vineet Mittal, Chairman, Avaada Group.“This intervention will help Indian developers cater to the requirement and augment the ongoing efforts to reach the target of 500 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2070,” he said.Road aheadEven before India had a stated policy for green hydrogen, private sector conglomerates like Reliance Industries Ltd, Adani Group, Larsen & Toubro, state-run companies like Indian Oil Corporation Ltd, NTPC Ltd, GAIL India Ltd, and renewable energy companies like ReNew Power, and ACME Group, had made big-bang announcements to enter the sector. Reliance Industries aims to reduce the production cost of green hydrogen to under $1/kg by the end of this decade. Whereas billionaire Gautam Adani has stated that Adani Group aspires to be among the biggest producers of green hydrogen in the world.The advances in technology, drop in prices, growing competition and government incentives have given these companies the confidence that the green hydrogen sector will take off over the next few years. But for that to happen, execution of policies by the government and projects by the companies would be key, experts said.""It is a crucial policy measure in establishing India as a leader in manufacturing and production of green hydrogen. What will be required alongside this ambitious mission is to create adequate demand by transiting hard-to-abate user industries through incentives and obligations towards green hydrogen,” said Shubhranshu Patnaik, Partner, Deloitte India.Seksaria of ACME Group believes that to some extent the ball is in the court of the developers now. “The government has indicated their plan and to a significant extent, done or is doing, what they have to do. Green hydrogen requires a lot of business development activity to ensure that we find a global customer and comply with global regulatory norms.”A big challenge, going ahead, would be to harmonise standards and certification systems for green hydrogen globally. While this is a challenge for countries across the world, India could play an important role in facilitating it, given its G20 presidency, industry players said.“While there is a long way to go, the Cabinet approval sends a positive signal to private and international investors, which is essential for this sector to develop. Moreover, the Mission will give the much-needed direction to the states to undertake their own priority-based actions that align with the overarching decarbonisation goal…If well synchronised and executed, this will enable India to achieve its intended long-term strategy,” said Tirthankar Mandal, Head of Energy Policy in the Energy Program at World Resources Institute, India.",Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.

"  January 05, 2023 / 12:37 PM IST  ",India’s Green Hydrogen Mission: These companies have committed to transition,"The government of India while clearing the National Green Hydrogen mission on January 4 also earmarked incentives worth Rs 17,490 crore for its production and manufacturing of electrolysers.But even as details of how these incentives will be rolled out are yet to be announced, a host of private sector conglomerates have already made pitches to go big on green hydrogen. Some of them announced their targets way back in 2021 when Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman first revealed about India’s plan to harness green hydrogen in her 2021 budget speech and later, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the National Hydrogen Energy Mission in his Independence Day speech in August the same year.For starters, green hydrogen is produced using renewable energy through electrolysis and thus, is carbon free. In this process, hydrogen is separated from oxygen in the water through an electric current. Renewable sources, such as solar or wind, are used in the requirement for electricity for electrolysis and hence, the colour “green” is attributed to this form of hydrogen.Moneycontrol takes a look at what companies have promised to accelerate India’s green hydrogen mission.ADANI GROUPOn June 14, 2022, Adani New Industries Ltd (ANIL) announced that it has partnered with France’s TotalEnergies SE to invest $50 billion over the next 10 years in India to produce green hydrogen and develop an ecosystem around it.In the initial phase, ANIL aims to develop green hydrogen production capacity of 1 million ton per annum before 2030.Last month (December, 2022), ANIL signed a development and licensing agreement with Cavendish Renewable Technology (CRT), a Melbourne based hydrogen technology firm, for development of alkaline electrolyses, polymer exchange membrane (PEMs), anion exchange membranes (AEMs) and CRT’s innovative “C-Cell” technology for mass scale production.RELIANCE INDUSTRIES LTD (RIL)On August 29, 2022, Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries said the company aims to transition to green hydrogen production, from grey now, by 2025. The company aims to reduce the production cost of green hydrogen to under $1/kg by the end of this decade.According to sources, RIL is in advanced talks with Hinduja-owned truck and bus maker Ashok Leyland for the development and supply chain of hydrogen-powered engines.Bloomberg on January 5 reported that Mukesh Ambani will be focusing his attention on RIL’s pivot to green energy. The 65-year-old will oversee strategy, including the building of gigafactories and blue hydrogen facilities, will assess acquisition targets, and is talking to potential investors, the people said, asking not to be named as the information isn’t public.Ambani last year unveiled plans to spend $75 billion on clean energy projects over the next 15 years.INDIAN OIL CORPORATION LTD (IOCL)IOCL is targeting to replace at least a tenth of its current fossil-fuel-based hydrogen at its refineries with green hydrogen as part of a decarbonisation drive. This year, the company is also going to set up subsidiary to house its green energy businesses.“The company is venturing into green hydrogen production and is targeting 5 percent of hydrogen produced by it as green hydrogen by 2027-28 and 10 per cent by 2029-30,” the PSU’s 2022 annual report stated.To start with, the nation's largest oil firm is setting up green hydrogen plants at its Panipat and Mathura refineries.Besides, Chennai petroleum corporation, a subsidiary of IOCL, has recently issued an EOI for the design, manufacturing and commissioning f the electrolyser and related items for the production of green hydrogen at its refinery at Manali in Chennai.ONGCIn July, 2022, India’s state-controlled Oil & Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and joint venture partner Greenko inked a pact to spend up to $6.2 billion on renewable energy and green hydrogen projects.GREENKO-KEPPEL DEALIn October, 2022, Greenko Group announced that India will for the first-time export green energy from 2025, with the first shipments going to a Singapore power plant as it signed a MoU with Singapore's Keppel Infrastructure.Through the MoU, the two companies will explore opportunities in green hydrogen in India. They are working towards a 250,000 tonne per annum contract to be supplied to Keppel’s new 600Mw power plant in Singapore.Greenko’s wide range of investments includes $5 billion in the storage of carbon-free green hydrogen energy across IndiaGAIL India Ltd On May 12, 2022, GAIL announced that it has awarded a contract to set up one of the largest Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) Electrolyser in India. The project would be installed at GAIL’s Vijaipur Complex, in Guna district of Madhya Pradesh, and would be based on renewable power. The project has been designed to produce around 4.3 MT of green hydrogen per day (approx. 10 MW capacity). It is scheduled to be commissioned by November 2023.In January, 2022, GAIL had commenced India’s first-of-it’s-kind project of mixing hydrogen into natural gas system.BHARAT PETROLEUM CORPORATION LTD (BPCL)BPCL is going to install a 5 MW electrolyser system to set up a green hydrogen production facility in a phased manner in one of its city gas distribution projects. In June, 2022, it invited bids for the same.In April 2022, BPCL signed a five-year Memorandum of Understanding with the Odisha government to explore the feasibility of setting up a renewable energy plant and a green hydrogen plant (both for domestic and export customers) among other things.The company has collaborated with Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) to work on alkaline electrolyser technology for Green Hydrogen production. It aims to scale up production of the electrolyser for commercial use, especially in refineries.NTPC LtdIndia’s largest electricity producer, NTPC, plans to use about 5 GW capacity in green hydrogen and ammonia business out of its 60 GW green portfolio target by 2032.NTPC has started three pilots on the hydrogen business. One is a pilot project of blending green hydrogen and natural gas at its Kawas plant in Gujarat. The second is in Leh where the company is setting up a green hydrogen filling station along with solar plants. The plan is to run hydrogen based fuel cell buses there as well. The third is a pilot project of producing hydrogen along with carbon capture at its Vindhyachal plant in Madhya Pradesh.LARSEN & TOUBRO LTD (L&T)Engineering major L&T commissioned a green hydrogen plant at its AM Naik Heavy Engineering Complex in Hazira, Gujarat in August 2022. The plant produces 45 Kg of green hydrogen on a daily basis, which is used for captive consumption in the company’s Hazira manufacturing complex.The company has also signed an agreement with Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay to jointly pursue research and development work in the green hydrogen value chain.In January, 2022, L&T signed a pact with Norway-based electrolyser technology and manufacturer HydrogenPro AS to set up a unit in India. As per the memorandum of understanding, L&T and HydrogenPro will work towards setting up of a gigawatt-scale manufacturing unit for alkaline water electrolysers  based on HydrogenPro technology.In December 2021, L&T tied up with Nasdaq-listed ReNew Power to jointly develop, own, execute and operate green hydrogen projects in India.HPCL Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) aims to have a green hydrogen capacity of 24,000 tonnes a year, and hopes to commission a 370-tonne-a-year-capacity green hydrogen plant at its Vizag refinery.",NTPC Ltd.
"  January 05, 2023 / 10:05 AM IST  ",India’s $2-billion green hydrogen mission needs push from government: Industry,"India has made a serious bet of over $2 billion on green hydrogen and entered the global race for developing green energy to ensure the country’s energy security, but the devil lies in the details. The industry which made a beeline to enter the sector even before the country announced its policy, now awaits the details of the plan.On January 4, the Union Cabinet approved the National Green Hydrogen Mission with a total initial outlay of Rs 19,744 crore. The country wants to develop manufacturing capacity for the clean energy source and emerge as a global hub for it.While Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the ‘National Hydrogen Mission’ from the Red Fort on Independence Day in 2021, this is the first concrete commitment towards the ambition to boost the growth of green hydrogen in the country. The ministry had launched a part of the national hydrogen policy on February 17, but that did not include incentives that the industry was vying for.“The Indian government is among the first few to have put the money on the table for green hydrogen; it is in the top four-five countries that have committed money. Now that the ministry knows that they have this kitty to work with, they will work out the exact mechanics of who gets what, and the procedure. Unfortunately, there is no existing template for the incentives, as this is a new space. So, they will have to work it out, but they have been engaging with the industry closely,” Rajat Seksaria, Chief Executive Officer, ACME Group, told Moneycontrol.But while India has thrown its hat in the ring, its success hinges on how the incentives would be planned and executed, and how the country manages to create demand locally.The big pushIndia aims to produce at least five million tonnes (MT) of green hydrogen per annum by 2030, with a potential to reach 10 MT per annum that could even cater to the export market. The country hopes to progressively replace hydrogen produced from fossil fuels with the cleaner green hydrogen in petroleum refining and fertiliser production.Industry players told Moneycontrol that the timing of the Cabinet approval, just ahead of the Union Budget that is scheduled to be announced on February 1, indicates that the government is making sure that resources are made available to finance this initiative.Of the Rs 19,744 crore outlay announced, around Rs 17,490 crore will be towards incentives for production of green hydrogen and manufacturing of electrolysers. The government is referring to this as the Strategic Interventions for Green Hydrogen Transition Programme (SIGHT). Another Rs 1,466 crore will be for pilot projects, while Rs 400 crore is committed to research and development (R&D), and Rs 388 crore to other mission components, respectively.The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) will formulate the scheme guidelines for implementation of the respective components, Union Minister Anurag Thakur said in a briefing to reporters after the approval. Industry players are hopeful that this will be done in the next two months since the government has been engaging with the industry for over a year and has already received feedback.“Indian hydrogen demand is anticipated to see a five-fold jump to 28 MT by 2050, along with tremendous opportunities that exist for exports. The impetus will translate into increased cooperation between the government, private players and innovators to make green hydrogen, the fuel of the future, and India, a leader in the green energy space,” said Vineet Mittal, Chairman, Avaada Group.“This intervention will help Indian developers cater to the requirement and augment the ongoing efforts to reach the target of 500 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2070,” he said.Road aheadEven before India had a stated policy for green hydrogen, private sector conglomerates like Reliance Industries Ltd, Adani Group, Larsen & Toubro, state-run companies like Indian Oil Corporation Ltd, NTPC Ltd, GAIL India Ltd, and renewable energy companies like ReNew Power, and ACME Group, had made big-bang announcements to enter the sector.
