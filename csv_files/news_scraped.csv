"  August 12, 2023 / 11:07 AM IST  ",Buy Coal India; target of Rs 270: Sharekhan,"Sharekhan's research report on Coal IndiaQ1 results were strong with a sharp 36% beat in consolidated PAT at Rs. 7,971 crore (up 44% q-o-q) led by better-than-expected margin given significantly lower employee cost and a marginally higher blended realization partially offset by lower other income. FSA/e-auction realisation of Rs. 1,536/Rs. 3,742 per tonne was 2%/30% above our estimate. E-auction premium of 144% was lower q-o-q but was above expectation of 90%. Coal offtake of 187mt (up 5% y-o-y; flat q-o-q) with FSA/e-auction volume at 168 mt/16mt, flat q-o-q. Soft international coal prices would lower e-auction realisations, while we expect Coal India (CIL) to take FSA coal price hike to offset higher cost. Also, coal production/offtake has witnessed strong growth of 10%/6% y-o-y during April-July 2023. Overall, we expect healthy earnings momentum to sustain although it would moderate compared to peak PAT seen in FY23.OutlookValuation of 5.6x its FY25E EPS (close to trough valuation) is attractive and the stock offers a high dividend yield of ~10%. Hence, we maintain a Buy on Coal India with an unchanged PT of Rs. 270. Potential stake sale in Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL) and subsequent listing would unlock value.For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

"  August 12, 2023 / 10:42 AM IST  ",Buy Coal India; target of Rs 265: Axis Securities,"Axis Securities report on Coal IndiaCIL posted a decent set of numbers. Revenue (up 3% YoY, down 6% QoQ) beat our estimate by 2% led by higher ASP (down 4%/6% YoY/QoQ) which stood ahead of our estimate by 2%. EBITDA (down 14%YoY, up 52% QoQ) beat our estimates by 16%, mainly on account of lower RM costs, which are partially offset by higher-than-expected employee and contractual expenses. In Q4FY23, CIL took provision towards employee expenses of Rs 5,870 Cr. Attrib. PAT stood at Rs 7,971 Cr, down 10% YoY (up 44% QoQ), beating our estimate led by higher other income and lower D&A expenses.OutlookWe continue to value the stock at 4.0x 1-year forward EV/EBITDA multiple on FY25E Adj. EBITDA. We arrive at our target price of Rs 265/share (from Rs 275/share), implying an upside of 15% from the CMP.For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.
