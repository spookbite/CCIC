      "description": "\"What is the cutoff time for placing a Mutual Funds order to receive the same-day NAV ???\"\n\u00a0\nA mutual fund\u2019s assets value changes every working day.\nThat is how it goes up over time (or down if it is a bad mutual fund). This change reflects in the NAV on every working day.\nThe cut-off time decides which day\u2019s NAV you get. If you invest after the cut-off time on any given day, you\u2019ll get the next day\u2019s NAV. If invested before the cut-off time, then same day\u2019s NAV.\nThis cut-off is different for different mutual funds. For most mutual funds, the cut off is 3 pm.\nMany investors obsess about this.\nThe truth is, a difference of one day in getting the NAV doesn\u2019t really make much difference in the long term.\nMost investors should not worry too much about it."
