When central banks decrease the rates, the yields fall.\nThe way bonds work is complex and interesting. Do make sure you read more on this."

You can then go and check why that happened.\nLikewise, you can check how the stock price behaves on important dates like the dividend date, quarterly results date, etc.\nThis can help you understand how resilient a stock price is to certain events, which events affect that stock more, etc.\nExample, when the markets were crashing in 2020, FMCG sector stocks were shooting up unlike other stocks.\nMissed last week's course?

      "description": "\"In ELSS Scheme after 3 year lock in period withdrawal amount will be taxable or not?\"\nProfits or gains from investing in ELSS funds is taxable.\nIt is paid only when you withdraw. Say you invest Rs 1.5 lakh in 2019. The lock-in ends in 2022. But you take out this money in 2025.\nSo you will have to pay a tax in 2025 only.\nAlso, it is on the gain or profit, not the entire amount.\nThere is a Rs 1 lakh exemption on gains from equity.\nSo only if your gains from equity (shares, equity mutual funds, ELSS, etc) in a given year is higher than Rs 1 lakh do you pay tax.\nOtherwise, you pay Rs 0 in taxes (you still have to show it when you file your taxes).\n------------------\nIn this section, daily, we'll try to answer one burning question related to the field of personal finance education.\u00a0\nRemember, NO investment advice & ONLY personal finance education questions.\u00a0\nAsk your question here: Ask a question"

    "content": "Fact: Nifty has fallen between 1% and 2% about 110 times in the last 5 years.\nCommodity markets ended higher on the news of China reopening its economy. This happens because China is one of India's major trade partners.\nThe US bond yields fell on expecting slower rate hikes because of which the Indian bond yields also ended lower.\nThe reason why bond yields fall on slower rate hikes is explained later in the 'Word of the Day' section.\nBoth India and the US will announce their inflation numbers coming Thursday.\nAll sectors ended in the red today. Bank stocks fell the most."
