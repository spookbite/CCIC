These might be different in some cases on BSE and NSE.\nFor example, the trading symbol of Adani Enterprises is ADANIENT. AU Small Finance Bank = AUBANK. Aurobindo Pharma = AUROPHARMA.

Are the electricity and water supply in place and working? Does the area face flooding?\nHow is the connectivity? Close to markets, bus stands, hospitals, etc?\nPhysical inspection is very vast \u2014 do make a list and check each of those factors closely. \nMissed last week's course?

      "description": "\"Is it advisable to break old FDs to get better interest rates?\"\n\u00a0\nRemember, breaking an FD usually has a penalty.\nIn many cases, after calculating the penalty, it does not make sense to break an FD. Sometimes it does.\nSo, when you break an FD, you must ask this question: which gives more profit?\n1. Break FD, pay the penalty, and then invest in higher-interest FD2. Keep money in the same FD\nIn which case do you stand to gain more? Decide based only on that."

The US and Asian markets along with SGX Nifty ended lower.\nThe reopening of the Chinese economy has raised concerns about the spread of the virus. But it may also revive demand for goods - reasons that led to mixed global cues.\nEnergy, realty, auto, and consumption stocks ended in the green today."
