    "content": "Happy New Year 2023!\nIndian markets kicked off the new year with around 0.5% gains. They remained in the green throughout the session.\nSGX Nifty was in the red, and US markets ended lower in their previous session. This usually signals a negative start for Indian markets.\nDespite that, both indices gained through the day.\nA few reports said markets rose because of the gain in metal stocks. Analysts shared a positive view on metal stocks due to the easing of curbs in China.\nNifty Metal was up 2.43% today, followed by Nifty PSE (Public sector enterprise), which was up 1.42%, and Nifty CDTY (Commodities) 1.28%.\nConsumption and pharma indices were the only losers.\nFact: Nifty has risen between 0% and 1% about 501 times in the last 5 years."
