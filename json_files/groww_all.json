      "description": "Theme: momentum investing\nDay 1: Monday\nThere are different kinds of investing strategies used by different investors. One such strategy is called momentum strategy.\nIn recent years, it has gained popularity. It is a promising strategy but can also be risky.\nIn momentum, stocks that are climbing up are bought. They are sold as soon as they show signs of downward movement.\nIt\u2019s a bit more complicated than that, but this is the gist of it.\nIt is basically taking a bet on the behaviour of investors to double down on stocks that are rising. And momentum investors aim to be one of the early ones to leave when a stock falls.\nFurther in this course, we\u2019ll go deeper into how all of this works.\nMissed last week's course?

      "description": "\"Which is better to invest in MF : SIP route or lump sum investment\"\nThere is no \u2019better\u2019.\nIt depends on how your money stands.\nFirst things first, for most normal investors, it does not make sense to accumulate money in your bank for months and then invest in one go (lump sum).\nLike if you have a salary. It doesn\u2019t make sense to accumulate the amount and then invest. SIP is more suitable here.\nIf you suddenly have a certain amount of money like an extra bonus you earned, a property sale, etc, then you can think of a lump sum investment.\nIn equity mutual funds, it is usually suggested to invest via the STP option.\nIn STP (Systematic Transfer Plan), you invest the entire amount in a debt fund and transfer it gradually to an equity fund.\nIt is like starting an SIP but instead of deducting money from your bank, it deducts money from a debt fund where you invested.\nThis reduces the chance of your lump sum investment getting caught in a single-day market spike \u2014 therefore reducing the risk a bit.\n------------------\nIn this section, daily, we'll try to answer one burning question related to the field of personal finance education.\u00a0\nRemember, NO investment advice & ONLY personal finance education questions.\u00a0\nAsk your question here: Ask a question"
