      "description": "Investment made in ELSS funds can be used to give tax benefits in the current financial year only \u2014 even though they\u2019re locked-in for 3 years.\nThis means, every new financial year, you need to make fresh investments in an ELSS fund to avail tax benefit under section 80C.\nAny extra amount invested in one year does not carry over benefits to the next year.\nOnly investments made in a financial year can be used for benefits in the same financial year.\nDo note, ELSS mutual funds\u2019 lock-in of 3 years is the shortest lock-in period among all tax-savings investments.\nOther options like tax savings FD, NPS, etc have much longer lock-in periods.\nIt goes without saying, ELSS mutual funds\u2019 returns aren\u2019t fixed or guaranteed. So far, they\u2019ve given the highest returns (over the long term) among all tax-savings investment options."

      "description": "\"What are Index Funds and how it differs from normal funds ?\"\n\u00a0\nMutual funds are active funds \u2014 meaning, the decision to buy, sell, or hold stocks is made by a fund manager and his/her team.\nThey research and choose stocks based on their investment philosophy.\nThe decision-making is active in nature.\nIndex funds on the other hand are passive. No person makes a buy or sell decision.\nIndex funds merely replicate an index.\nFor example, the index Nifty 50 is made up of the 50 biggest companies in India.\nSo a Nifty 50 index fund invests its money in the 50 biggest stocks in India maintaining weightage.\nIt also maintains the same weightage as the companies\u2019 size.\nSo, Reliance is the biggest company in India - the index fund will buy more shares of Reliance, then next, the 2nd biggest company, and so on."
