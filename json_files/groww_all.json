Usually, if the GDP of a country falls for 2 quarters, the country is said to be in a recession.\nA recession can last relatively longer \u2014 anywhere from 6 months to a few years.\nA recession is also said to be temporary in nature \u2014 recovery from a recession is expected.\nThis definition is not fixed.\nRecently, the USA\u2019s economy contracted for 2 quarters but the US government did not call it a recession citing other positive economic indicators.\nSome agreed with them. Some criticised them for not declaring a recession.\nMissed last week's course? You can download the course PDF - click to download."

      "description": "\"When prices of shares follow the usual demand and supply rule and vary accordingly, why is the company's performance even relevant? Theoretically, even if a company is performing poorly but people are buying its shares then the price should always go up. So shouldn't people buying/trading the stocks keep the share price at par? Why do people consider the performance of companies?\"\n\u00a0\nIf a company makes good profits, you get more profits \u2014 in the form of dividend (or share buybacks).\nSo, when a company\u2019s profits go up, it becomes more attractive to investors. They\u2019re willing to pay a higher price for the stock.\nIf more people are willing to pay a higher price for a stock, the stock price rises.\nIn short, the price is linked to the demand and supply for a stock \u2014 but the demand and supply for a stock is linked to the company\u2019s performance (income, revenue, etc).\nIt must be noted here, not all companies give dividends or do buybacks. These companies are reinvesting their earnings back into the business to grow it further.\nEven these companies are expected to give dividends or do share buybacks at some point in the future when they\u2019re done aggressively growing."
