Then, find out how many of the required NOCs are not obtained already.\nSome NOCs are easy to get. Some NOCs can be difficult to obtain. Factor these before deciding on a property purchase. \nMissed last week's course? You can download the course PDF - click to download."

      "description": "\"What are the basic difference between balanced and balanced advantage mutual fund? What is suitable for a senior citizen of low risk appetite?\"\n\u00a0\nBalanced funds are funds that invest in both equity (eg. share markets) and debt (bonds, fixed-income securities, etc).\nA conservative balanced fund invests a majority of its money in debt and a smaller portion in equity.\nAn aggressive balanced fund invests a majority of its money in equity and a smaller portion in debt.\nA balanced advantage fund is one that can switch between being a majority in equity or a majority in debt.\nIt does not have to stick to being just debt-heavy or just equity-heavy.\nSuitability for senior citizens: this is really an individual decision. Senior citizens are usually less risk-taking.\nBut then, many argue all balanced funds are relatively lower-risk than equity funds.\nThere is no right or wrong answer. Each investor should evaluate and invest."

    "content": "Fact: Nifty has fallen between 0% and 1% about 415 times in the last 5 years.\nThe markets ended in the red today.\nHowever the change was almost flat, mostly because of mixed global cues.\nThe day started with the markets erasing Tuesday's gains. The US and Asian markets along with SGX Nifty ended lower.\nThe reopening of the Chinese economy has raised concerns about the spread of the virus. But it may also revive demand for goods - reasons that led to mixed global cues.\nEnergy, realty, auto, and consumption stocks ended in the green today."
