This week, we\u2019ll discuss some of these terms.\nPullback.\nA pullback is a short period of a stock price or markets falling \u2014 maybe a few days \u2014 after it had risen.\nUsually, it is seen as an opportunity to buy. The downward movement is viewed as a temporary negative movement.\nPullback happens from a recent high or peak. A stock or index that is already moving down and continues falling is not said to be a case of a pullback.\nPullbacks are extremely common in the markets."

      "description": "\"Why some companies have very high PE, but still continues to hold the higher PE ratio even though the market sentiment is negative?\"\n\u00a0\nMany times, some companies have high PE ratios (price-to-earnings ratio) because investors expect the company to do well in the future.\nSo they buy more, causing the price to go up while the earnings haven\u2019t increased yet.\nMany times, when the market sentiment is negative, investors fear most stocks will perform poorly.\nIn such cases, they feel comfortable putting their money into stocks that they think are stable and reliable.\nTherefore, when most stocks are negative, some stocks can attract a lot of attention and investment from others \u2014 causing their share price and PE ratio to go up."
