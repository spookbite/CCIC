There are many filters in screeners \u2014 most stock investing platforms offer stock screeners.\nMany investors also use screeners to look for new investment ideas.\nMissed last week's course?

      "description": "\"Is large cap funds and index funds are same?\"\nThey can be similar. But they are not the same.\nAn index fund invests in an index \u2014 a list of stocks. Like, the 30 biggest companies (Sensex 30), the 50 biggest companies (Nifty 50), and so on.\nIn index funds, no fund manager makes the buy/sell/hold decision.\nThe stocks are bought and sold based on their weightage in the list (or index).\nIn case of an index fund tracking the 50 biggest stocks in India, the index fund will invest the highest in the biggest company\u2019s stock, then the 2nd biggest, and so on.\nMost index funds invest in large-cap stocks (100 biggest companies in India). But there can be an index fund investing in smaller companies also (mid-cap, small-cap, etc).\nIn large-cap mutual funds (not index funds), the decision to buy/sell/hold a stock is made by a fund manager. It is his/her wish.\nThe only rule they have to follow is that at least 80% of the money should be invested in large-cap stocks.\n------------------\nIn this section, daily, we'll try to answer one burning question related to the field of personal finance education.\u00a0\nRemember, NO investment advice & ONLY personal finance education questions.\u00a0\nAsk your question here: Ask a question"
