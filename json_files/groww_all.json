The ones discussed in this course so far are just a few examples."

But what about the profits/losses? Are they returned yearly?\"\n\u00a0\nDon\u2019t think of mutual funds like FD. Forget the concept of principal amount and interest.\nOnce you invest, that investment is locked for 3 years.\nIf the value of your investment rises, it is still counted as the same investment. So the amount and its profits/losses are locked for 3 years.\nAfter 3 years, you can withdraw anytime or let it continue to remain invested."
