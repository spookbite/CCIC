Smaller portions are invested in mid and small-cap stocks.\nThese are all actively managed funds.\nSEBI has just given the permission for passive ELSS funds. This would mean the ELSS funds invest in an index. No fund manager makes the buy/sell decision.\nRegardless, the main motive of ELSS funds remains the same: generate higher returns while saving tax."

      "description": "\"Why there is share price variations in BSE & NSE?\"\nAny share\u2019s price is determined by supply and demand.\nOn both exchanges, BSE and NSE, trading is happening at the same time \u2014 causing the prices to go up and down.\nIt is possible that a stock climbs/falls more on one exchange. This happens because of a difference in supply and demand on the different exchanges.\nThere could be more buyers on one exchange and more sellers on another exchange.\nThis is why there is a difference.\nBut do note, most of the time, the prices are either the same or very similar.\nWhy?\nBecause if the stock is priced lower on one exchange, people start buying from it and selling at the exchange where the price is higher \u2014 for a profit.\nThis causes the difference in prices to become very small or vanish."
