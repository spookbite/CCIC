      "description": "Theme: tax-saver mutual funds\nDay 3: Wednesday\nAnother crucial fact to realise is that with ELSS, you can only get a tax benefit under section 80C.\nSection 80C allows a total tax benefit of up to Rs 1.5 lakh.\nWhich means, while calculating tax, you can reduce your income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh before calculating tax.\nSection 80C is made up of many other components also. You can use insurance, FD investment, etc in section 80C also.\nSo plan accordingly. You might not need to invest Rs 1.5 lakh in ELSS \u2014 you might be able to invest less also.\nAny extra amount invested in an ELSS fund will not give you tax benefits. But the extra amount will remain locked-in for 3 years \u2014 that is the rule.\nSo plan your investments and tax carefully.\nMissed last week's course?

      "description": "\"How the compounding works in mutual fund? Like the gain/loss keeps fluctuating thorugh out the year and beyond so when does the amc actually takes the gain of the fund to give us the compounding return. CAGR is understandable but how it actually works if i have to compare it with bank fd .\"\n\u00a0\nThe best way to think about mutual fund investment is to think in terms of a real estate investment (and not FD).\nWhen you buy a house, do you get annual returns? Is there a \u2018principal\u2019 or \u2018interest\u2019?\nNo.\nThe price of the house itself goes up.\nWhen you sell the house, you can use the final price of the house, and compare it with the price you bought it at.\nUsing that, you can find the effective per annum returns of that investment.\nIt works similarly with mutual funds also.\n------------------\nIn this section, daily, we'll try to answer one burning question related to the field of personal finance education.\u00a0\nRemember, NO investment advice & ONLY personal finance education questions.\u00a0\nAsk your question here: Ask a question"
