Likewise, there are other scarier terms like \u2018market rout\u2019, \u2018bloodbath\u2019, and a few others.\nNewer words are coined on social media every now and then \u2014 almost none of them have a clear definition.\nInvestors must understand that when viewing a stock\u2019s falling price or a market\u2019s falling index, such terms are not of much use.\nInvestors must also observe the percentage by which the fall has occurred more than anything else and decide for themselves.\nMissed last week's course?

      "description": "\"Why SIP in Mutual Funds is being encouraged so often?\"\nThere are many reasons why. Some main reasons are:\n-Investing every month. This sounds simple but is a surprisingly big problem. Investors tend to forget or skip investing often. With SIP, the investment automatically happens every month.\nEven though the investor can cancel the SIP at any time, many don\u2019t cancel.\n-Another reason is that it averages investments going into the mutual fund. When you invest regularly via SIP, on some days, the markets will be high and on some days, it will be low.\nThus, by starting an SIP, an investor reduces the risk of getting into the market at the wrong time with his/her entire investment amount."
